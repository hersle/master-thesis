\section*{Metric signature}

We use the $(-,+,+,+)$ metric signature.

\section*{Units}

We use natural units in which the speed of light $c = 1$.

\section*{Summation convention}

We use the Einstein summation convention, in which an index that appears once as a superscript and again as a subscript in the same term is to be summed over.
If the index is roman, the sum runs from $1$ to $3$, and if it is greek, it also runs over $0$.
For example,
\begin{equation*}
	T\indices{^\mu_\mu} = \sum_{\mu=0}^3 T\indices{^\mu_\mu}
	\quad \text{and} \quad
	T\indices{^i_i} = \sum_{i=1}^3 T\indices{^i_i}
	.
\end{equation*}
