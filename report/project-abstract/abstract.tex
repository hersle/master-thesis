\section*{Project thesis (\cref{part:project})}

General relativity and quantum field theory are indispensable for studying compact stars that are composed of subatomic particles with extreme density.
In this project, we solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for a cold Fermi gas composed of free neutrons, producing a mass-radius curve for ideal neutron stars parametrized by central pressure, then finally analyze their stability.
First, we derive the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations from the Einstein field equations in a radially symmetric metric for a perfect fluid in equilibrium.
Second, we present thermal field theory and use it to express the partition function of a free Fermi gas as a path integral.
Next, we combine these two results by numerically integrating the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations with the equation of state that follows from the partition function, yielding the mass-radius curve.
Finally, we apply perturbation theory to the initial equilibrium analysis of general relativity to find a Sturm-Liouville problem that determines normal radial vibration modes of stars out of equilibrium, then solve it with the shooting method to analyze the stability of the stars.
%Along the way, we review general relativity, discover the Buchdal limit for stars, take a particularly detailed look on fermionic coherent states and demonstrate the technique of Matsubara energy summation.
%\TODO{should I omit the preceeding sentence?}
Our mass-radius curve reproduces the upper mass limit of 0.71 solar masses for neutron stars originally calculated by Oppenheimer and Volkoff in 1939.
Likewise, our quantitative stability analysis confirms the correctness of a set of qualitative rules based on curvature and extrema in the mass-radius diagram.
Many observations have been made of neutron stars around 2 solar masses, so the model is too simple for describing real neutron stars.
Nevertheless, this project establishes a broad and solid base platform from which one can continue to study more advanced models for compact stars.

\section*{Master thesis (\cref{part:master})}

According to the theory of quantum chromodynamics,
quarks are confined in baryons at low densities and temperatures,
but break free into a state of deconfined quark matter at high densities due to the property of asymptotic freedom.
Neutron stars, predominantly composed of baryons like neutrons and protons,
could therefore contain a core of quark matter if its density reaches sufficiently high levels
in what is then referred to as a hybrid star.
There could even exist pure quark stars composed almost only of quark matter.
After reviewing the conventional MIT bag model,
we model quark stars using the effective quark-meson model of quantum chromodynamics,
calculating its grand potential to one fermion loop with the mean-field approximation for bosons.
We find maximum masses $M \leq 2.0 \, M_\odot$ with the two-flavor model and $M \leq 1.8 \, M_\odot$ with its three-flavor generalization.
In particular, the parameter space of the quark-meson model contains the $\sigma$-meson mass whose measured values we struggle to fit to the grand potential at tree-level.
Using the results of recent work, however,
we resolve this issue by fitting the parameters consistently at one loop level.
Finally, we assemble hybrid stars by combining the three-flavor quark-meson model with the hadronic Akmal-Pandharipande-Ravenhall equation of state,
generating a short branch of stable hybrid stars with masses up to $M \leq 2.1 \, M_\odot$ and small quark cores of about $0.01 M_\odot$.
A discontinuous phase transition destabilizes stars with heavier quark cores.
Our results are compatible with earlier work done using variations of the quark-meson model and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.
