  abstract = {Pulsar Tests Gravity                            Because of their extremely high densities, massive neutron stars can be used to test gravity. Based on spectroscopy of its white dwarf companion,                                Antoniadis                 et al.                              (p.               448               ) identified a millisecond pulsar as a neutron star twice as heavy as the Sun. The observed binary's orbital decay is consistent with that predicted by general relativity, ruling out previously untested strong-field phenomena predicted by alternative theories. The binary system has a peculiar combination of properties and poses a challenge to our understanding of stellar evolution.                        ,              Observations of a pulsar confirm general relativity in the strong-field regime and reveal a perplexing stellar binary.           ,                             Many physically motivated extensions to general relativity (GR) predict substantial deviations in the properties of spacetime surrounding massive neutron stars. We report the measurement of a 2.01 ± 0.04 solar mass (               M               ☉               ) pulsar in a 2.46-hour orbit with a 0.172 ± 0.003               M               ☉               white dwarf. The high pulsar mass and the compact orbit make this system a sensitive laboratory of a previously untested strong-field gravity regime. Thus far, the observed orbital decay agrees with GR, supporting its validity even for the extreme conditions present in the system. The resulting constraints on deviations support the use of GR-based templates for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the system strengthens recent constraints on the properties of dense matter and provides insight to binary stellar astrophysics and pulsar recycling.},

Using a lucid style, Carroll first covers the foundations of the theory and mathematical formalism, providing an approachable introduction to what can often be an intimidating subject. Three major applications of general relativity are then discussed: black holes, perturbation theory and gravitational waves, and cosmology. Students will learn the origin of how spacetime curves (the Einstein equation) and how matter moves through it (the geodesic equation). They will learn what black holes really are, how gravitational waves are generated and detected, and the modern view of the expansion of the universe. A brief introduction to quantum field theory in curved spacetime is also included. A student familiar with this book will be ready to tackle research-level problems in gravitational physics"–},

  abstract = {We compute models for the equation of state (EoS) of the matter in the cores of hybrid stars. Hadronic matter is treated in the non-linear relativistic mean-field approximation, and quark matter is modeled by three-flavor local and non-local Nambu−Jona-Lasinio (NJL) models with repulsive vector interactions. The transition from hadronic to quark matter is constructed by considering either a soft phase transition (Gibbs construction) or a sharp phase transition (Maxwell construction). We find that high-mass neutron stars with masses up to [Formula: see text] may contain a mixed phase with hadrons and quarks in their cores, if global charge conservation is imposed via the Gibbs conditions. However, if the Maxwell conditions is considered, the appearance of a pure quark matter core either destabilizes the star immediately (commonly for non-local NJL models) or leads to a very short hybrid star branch in the mass-radius relation (generally for local NJL models).},

  abstract = {We use the Polyakov-loop extended two-flavor quark-meson model as a low-energy effective model for QCD to study 1) the possibility of inhomogeneous chiral condensates and its competition with a homogeneous pion condensate in the \$μ\$--\$μ\_I\$ plane at \$T=0\$ and 2) the phase diagram in the \$μ\_I\$--\$T\$ plane. In the \$μ\$--\$μ\_I\$ plane, we find that an inhomogeneous chiral condensate only exists for pion masses lower that 37.1 MeV and does not coexist with a homogeneous pion condensate. In the \$μ\_I\$--\$T\$ plane, we find that the phase transition to a Bose-condensed phase is of second order for all values of \$μ\_I\$ and we find that there is no pion condensation for temperatures larger than approximately 187 MeV. The chiral critical line joins the critical line for pion condensation at a point, whose position depends on the Polyakov-loop potential and the sigma mass. For larger values of \$μ\_I\$ these curves are on top of each other. The deconfinement line enters smoothly the phase with the broken \$O(2)\$ symmetry. We compare our results with recent lattice simulations and find overall good agreement},

  abstract = {§ 1. It was shown by Bothe and Becker that some light elements when bombarded by α-particles of polonium emit radiations which appear to be of the γ-ray type. The element beryllium gave a particularly marked effect of this kind, and later observations by Bothe, by Mme. Curie-Joliot and by Webster showed that the radiation excited in beryllium possessed a penetrating power distinctly greater than that of any γ-radiation yet found from the radioactive elements. In Webster’s experiments the intensity of the radiation was measured both by means of the Geiger-Müller tube counter and in a high pressure ionisation chamber. He found that the beryllium radiation had an absorption coefficient in lead of about 0·22 cm. -1 as measured under his experimental conditions. Making the necessary corrections for these conditions, and using the results of Gray and Tarrant to estimate the relative contributions of scattering, photoelectric absorption, and nuclear absorption in the absorption of such penetrating radiation, Webster concluded that the radiation had a quantum energy of about 7 × 10 6 electron volts. Similarly he found that the radiation from boron bombarded by α-particles of polonium consisted in part of a radiation rather more penetrating than that from beryllium, and he estimated the quant um energy of this component as about 10 X 10 6 electron volts. These conclusions agree quite well with the supposition that the radiations arise by the capture of the α-particle into the beryllium (or boron) nucleus and the emission of the surplus energy as a quantum of radiation. The radiations showed, however, certain peculiarities, and at my request the beryllium radiation was passed into an expansion chamber and several photographs were taken. No unexpected phenomena were observed though, as will be seen later, similar experiments have now revealed some rather striking events. The failure of these early experiments was partly due to the weakness of the available source of polonium, and partly to the experimental arrangement, which, as it now appears, was not very suitable.},

  abstract = {We summarize our current knowledge of neutron-star masses and radii. Recent instrumentation and computational advances have resulted in a rapid increase in the discovery rate and precise timing of radio pulsars in binaries in the past few years, leading to a large number of mass measurements. These discoveries show that the neutron-star mass distribution is much wider than previously thought, with three known pulsars now firmly in the 1.9–2.0-M ⊙ mass range. For radii, large, high-quality data sets from X-ray satellites as well as significant progress in theoretical modeling led to considerable progress in the measurements, placing them in the 10–11.5-km range and shrinking their uncertainties, owing to a better understanding of the sources of systematic errors. The combination of the massive-neutron-star discoveries, the tighter radius measurements, and improved laboratory constraints of the properties of dense matter has already made a substantial impact on our understanding of the composition and bulk properties of cold nuclear matter at densities higher than that of the atomic nucleus, a major unsolved problem in modern physics.},

Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.             The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.             The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            The confinement/deconfinement transition described the Polyakov–Nambu–Jona–Lasinio (PNJL) model is extended to be operative at zero temperature regime. In this study, the scalar and vector channel interaction strengths of the original PNJL model are modified by introducing a dependence on the traced Polyakov loop. In such a way the effective interactions depend on the quark phase and in turn provides a backreaction of the quarks to the gluonic sector, also at zero temperature. On general grounds from quantum chromodynamics this is an expected feature. The thermodynamics of the extended model (PNJL0) is studied in detail.

My derivation is in line with Chandrasekhar's original derivation for the pulsation equation of a single-fluid compact star and keeps the contributions from the individual fluids manifest. I illustrate solutions to the system of pulsations equations with one-, two-, and three-fluid examples.},

  abstract = {We discuss possible scenarios for the existence of strange matter in compact stars. The appearance of hyperons leads to a hyperon puzzle in ab-initio approaches based on effective baryon-baryon potentials but is not a severe problem in relativistic mean field models. In general, the puzzle can be resolved in a natural way if hadronic matter gets stiffened at supersaturation densities, an effect based on the quark Pauli quenching between hadrons. We explain the conflict between the necessity to implement dynamical chiral symmetry breaking into a model description and the conditions for the appearance of absolutely stable strange quark matter that require both, approximately masslessness of quarks and a mechanism of confinement. The role of strangeness in compact stars (hadronic or quark matter realizations) remains unsettled. It is not excluded that strangeness plays no role in compact stars at all. To answer the question whether the case of absolutely stable strange quark matter can be excluded on theoretical grounds requires an understanding of dense matter that we have not yet reached.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Editor’s note               : One of the most important developments in theoretical particle physics at the end of the 20th century and beginning of the twenty-first century has been the development of effective field theories (EFTs). Pursuing an effective field theory approach is a methodology for constructing theories, where a set of core principles is agreed upon, such as Lorentz symmetry and unitarity, and all possible interactions consistent with them are then compulsory in the theory. The utility of this approach to particle physics (and beyond) is wide ranging and undisputed, as evidenced by the recent formation of the international seminar series               All Things EFT               (Talks in the series can be viewed at               https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1\_KF6kdJFoDEcLgpcegwCQ               (accessed 21 December 2020).) which brings together each week the worldwide community of EFT practitioners. The text below is a lightly edited version of the talk given by Prof. Weinberg on September 30, 2020, which inaugurated the series. The talk reviews some of the early history of EFTs from the perspective of its pioneer and concludes with a discussion of EFT implications for future discovery.},

  abstract = {The recent discovery of burst oscillation at 1122Hz in the X-ray transient XTE J1739-285 supports the suggestion that it contains a submillisecond pulsar. In our estimations of the enormous dissipation effect in the transition boundary layer between quark matter core and hadron matter envelope, combing the viscosities of bulk mater in previous works, we show that XTE J1739-285 can be uniquely restricted to a quark star masquerading as a neutron star (hybrid star) that contains a pure quark matter or mixed quark-hadron matter core from minimizing gravitational wave radiation (r-mode) instability and Keplerian motion constraints at 1122Hz level through a three-parameters image. Such constraints allow the stellar radii in the range \$9\{\textbackslash rm km\}\textbackslash leq R\textbackslash leq 12\{\textbackslash rm km\}\$ and the stellar masses in the range \$1.2M\_\textbackslash odot\textbackslash leq M\textbackslash leq 2.0M\_\textbackslash odot\$. It perhaps implies that submillisecond pulsars are just probes of quark matter.},
