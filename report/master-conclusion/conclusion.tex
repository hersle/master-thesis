In this thesis we have modeled quark stars using the MIT bag model and the quark-meson model with two and three flavors,
and finally hybrid stars by combining the quark-meson model and hadronic Akmal-Pandharipande-Ravenhall equation of state.
The resulting mass-radius relations are summarized in \cref{fig:conclusion:mass-radius},
and their maximum masses and corresponding radii are gathered in \cref{tab:master_conclusion:results}.

With the quark-meson model we could create pure quark stars with two flavors up to $M \leq 2.0 \, M_\odot$ and with three flavors up to $M \leq 1.8 \, M_\odot$.
Due to their softer equations of state, we saw that three-flavor stars are generally less massive than two-flavor stars.
Due to the instability of two-flavor quark matter compared to hadronic matter,
pure two-flavor quark stars are unlikely to be found in nature.
However, if the strange matter hypothesis is true,
strange quark stars consisting of three-flavor quark matter out to the surface can be stable and exist.
We failed to model strange quark stars self-consistently with the three-flavor quark-meson model,
as the bag constant exceeds its upper bound due to the strange matter hypothesis if the strange quark is to exist at surface.

The parameter space of the quark-meson model is particularly plagued by the ``ad-hoc'' $\sigma$-meson,
whose mass is only known to lie within $\SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt} \leq m_\sigma \leq \SI{550}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
Depending on its value, we saw that chiral symmetry restoration occurred in a rapid crossover for $m_\sigma \geq \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$,
but a discontinuous phase transition for $m_\sigma < \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
Moreover, we could only fit masses $m_\sigma \geq \SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt}$ that exceed the measurements
to prevent the ground state of the grand potential from vanishing in vacuum.
We nailed this problem down to the inconsistency of fitting parameters at tree-level to a potential that is calculated to one loop.
Repeating our calculation with a consistently fit potential in the large-$N_c$ limit found by Adhikari and others,
we learned that we could still trust our results,
as if inconsistently fit masses $\SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt} \leq m_\sigma \leq \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$
corresponds to consistently fit masses $\SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt} \leq m_\sigma \leq \SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
Such a consistently fit grand potential has only been found for the two-flavor model.

Using the quark-meson model in the core, we could also form short ranges of stable hybrid stars up to $M \leq 2.1 \, M_\odot$.
They contained very small quark cores no more massive than $0.12 M_\odot$ and $0.02 M_\odot$ with two and three flavors, respectively.
This resonates with the general view in \cite{ref:quark_star_review} that hybrid star quark cores are small.
Denser hybrid stars beyond the maximum mass are unstable against radial perturbations due to the discontinuous phase transition between the quark and hadron phases.
We find it possible to model hybrid stars with small quark cores around the recent mass observations \cite{ref:antoniadis,ref:arzoumanian,ref:fonseca}
of the heavy pulsars PSR J1614$-$2230, PSR J0348$+$0432 and PSR J0748$+$6620 around and above $2 M_\odot$.

The fact that hybrid stars seem to exhibit very small quark cores
make it very easy to mistake them for neutron stars.
It is difficult to decide whether a pulsar has a tiny quark core based on measurements made lightyears away from it.
With future advances in our theoretical understanding and observational techniques,
many observed neutron stars could really turn out to be hybrid stars.

In earlier work, \cite{ref:lsm3f_compact_stars} have modeled pure quark stars with a vector meson-extended three-flavor quark-meson model,
and this was incorporated into hybrid stars in \cite{ref:lsm3f_hybrid_stars}.
With the vector meson interaction turned off and using parameters comparable to ours,
they find hybrid stars with similar maximum masses $M \lesssim 1.9 M_\odot$ in \cite[figure 8]{ref:lsm3f_hybrid_stars}. % only B differs?
Quark stars have also been modeled with the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model in \cite{ref:quark_star_njl} and generalized to hybrid stars in \cite{ref:hybrid_stars_njl}, for example.
In \cite[figure 3]{ref:hybrid_stars_njl}, they also find maximum hybrid star masses $1.9 M_\odot \leq M \leq 2.1 M_\odot$ with reasonable parameter choices.
Even \cite{ref:quark_hybrid_additional_ref} find hybrid stars in the band $2.0 M_\odot \leq M \leq 2.1 M_\odot$
using a non-perturbative functional renormalization group approach with the quark-meson model.
Despite using different models for both the quark and hadronic phases,
our results are in good agreement with these works.

\section{Outlook}

A natural extension of our work would be to
explore the parameter space more thoroughly.
Our philosophy has been to keep almost all parameters fixed,
but vary the most uncertain parameter $m_\sigma$ and focus on the corresponding lowest stability-respecting $B$
because it generates greater maximum masses.
A more detailed treatment could also vary the quark masses,
other meson masses and use larger bag constants.
For example, \cite{ref:lsm3f_compact_stars}
find that the maximum mass increases with the quark masses $m_u=m_d$
with the variation of our model mentioned above.

Our treatment of bosons to tree-level and fermions to one loop was inconsistent in terms of loops,
but consistent in the large-$N_c$ approximation scheme.
It would be useful to refine calculations beyond bosonic mean fields.
We also saw that fitting parameters at tree-level to a one-loop grand potential was inconsistent
and performed a consistent one-loop fit in the two-flavor model using the results of \cite{ref:jo_lsm_consistent_chiral,ref:jo_lsm_consistent_physical}.
Such a consistently fit grand potential has not been found for the three-flavor model,
so it would be interesting to find one and see if the ability to fit experimental values of $m_\sigma$ carries over from the two-flavor model.

Different and more sophisticated effective models could also be examined.
For example, confinement could be incorporated with Polyakov-loop extended quark-meson models (PQM models, see for example \cite{ref:pqm_2f,ref:pqm_3f,ref:master_folkestad}) and NJL models (PNJL models, see for example \cite{ref:pnjl_2f,ref:pnjl_3f,ref:pnjl_3f_zeroT}).
It would also be interesting to see the effects of modeling the color-superconducting phase of the phase diagram in \cref{fig:qcd:phase_diagram}.

More effort could also be put into handling the phase transition in the hybrid stars more carefully.
For example, one could use interpolation techniques described in \cite{ref:quark_star_review}
near the intersection point of the transition,
where both the quark and hadronic equations of state are unreliable.
The interpolation is severely constrained by several physical requirements,
such as the speed of sound $v = c \sqrt{\odv{P}/{\epsilon}}$ not exceeding that of light.

One could also make more accurate calculations at nonzero temperature,
investigate effects of non-local charge neutrality,
and consider rotating stars that are more representative of observed pulsars than the static Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation by using a different spacetime metric.
