\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This thesis marks the end of five great years of studying physics at NTNU in Trondheim.

My supervisor, Professor Jens Oluf Andersen,
has regularly given me thoughtful and invaluable feedback on my work.
When I first met him,
I remember that I was a little lost as he sketched the plan for this thesis.
Over the coming two semesters, he guided me through the steps of this plan at an understanding and adaptive pace.
Looking back, I see very clearly how well-thought-out his plan was,
and how he has challenged me to take daunting steps into unknown territory along the way,
but always had realistic expectations of my work.
His friendliness makes him a breeze to cooperate with,
and his flexibility has encouraged me to work under freedom and to steer relevant pieces of the work into my interests and skills.
I am sincerely grateful for the time and effort he has devoted to me!

I also wish to thank my loving mother, father and grandparents
for their support in everything that I do
without ever laying pressure on me to do it.
I love you.

Last, but not least, I am very grateful to the large group of friends that I have spent much of my time in Trondheim with.
They have made life here very enjoyable and entertaining!

\chapter*{Disclaimer (to the examiner)}

%\begin{tcolorbox}[fonttitle=\bfseries, title=Disclaimer regarding evaluation]
This document joins the work of a project and master thesis and is split in three parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \Cref{part:project} comprises the project thesis.
\item \Cref{part:master} comprises the master thesis and builds upon the work of \cref{part:project}.
\item \Cref{part:appendices} comprises appendices for both \cref{part:project} and \cref{part:master}.
      Appendices \ref{chap:gr}, \ref{chap:relfluid}, \ref{chap:matsum} and \ref{chap:integrals} are part of the project thesis,
      while appendices \ref{chap:diracsea}, \ref{chap:lsm3fpotential} and \ref{chap:code} are part of the master thesis.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{During evaluation, \cref{part:master} and appendices \ref{chap:diracsea}, \ref{chap:lsm3fpotential} and \ref{chap:code} should be considered part of the master thesis.}
This structure is chosen to avoid self-plagiarism by clearly separating the two,
while maintaining the progression from \cref{part:project} to \cref{part:master}.
I believe both works are valuable to students in the future and would find it a shame to omit the project thesis from being published with the master thesis.
\Cref{part:master} frequently refers back to \cref{part:project} for readers who seek background information,
but such references are accompanied by short summaries for those who rather wish to read the master thesis independently of the project thesis.
