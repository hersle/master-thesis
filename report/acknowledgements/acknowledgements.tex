\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This thesis marks the end of five great years of studying physics at NTNU in Trondheim.

My supervisor, Professor Jens Oluf Andersen,
has regularly given me thoughtful and invaluable feedback on my work.
When I first met you,
I remember that I was a little lost as you sketched the plan for this thesis.
Over the coming two semesters, you guided me through the steps of your plan at an understanding and adaptive pace.
Looking back, I see very clearly how well-thought-out your plan was,
and how you challenged me to take daunting steps into unknown territory along the way
while always having realistic expectations of my work.
Your friendliness makes you a breeze to cooperate with,
and your flexibility has encouraged me to work under freedom and steer relevant pieces of the work towards my own interests and skills.
I am sincerely grateful for the time and effort you have devoted to me!

I also wish to thank my loving mother, father and grandparents,
in particular for supporting me in whatever I do
without ever pressuring me to do what you would do.
I love you!

Last, but not least, I am very grateful to the large group of fellow students that I have spent much of my time in Trondheim with.
You have made life here very enjoyable and entertaining!

%\begin{tcolorbox}[fonttitle=\bfseries, title=Disclaimer regarding evaluation]
This document joins the work of a project and master thesis and is split in three parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \Cref{part:project} comprises the project thesis.
\item \Cref{part:master} comprises the master thesis and builds upon the work of \cref{part:project}.
\item \Cref{part:appendices} comprises appendices for both \cref{part:project} and \cref{part:master}.
      %Appendices \ref{chap:gr}, \ref{chap:relfluid}, \ref{chap:matsum} and \ref{chap:integrals} are part of the project thesis,
      %while appendices \ref{chap:diracsea}, \ref{chap:lsm3fpotential} and \ref{chap:code} are part of the master thesis.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{During evaluation, \cref{part:master} and appendices \ref{chap:diracsea}, \ref{chap:lsm3fpotential} and \ref{chap:code} should be considered part of the master thesis.}
This structure was chosen to avoid self-plagiarism by clearly separating the work of the project thesis from the master thesis,
while maintaining continuity from \cref{part:project} to \cref{part:master}.
I believe both are valuable works and would find it a shame to omit the project thesis from being published with the master thesis.

\Cref{part:master} frequently refers back to \cref{part:project} for readers who seek background information,
but such references are accompanied by short summaries for those who rather wish to read the master thesis independently of the project thesis.
