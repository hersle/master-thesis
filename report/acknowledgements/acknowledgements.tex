This document combines the work of a project and master thesis and is split in three parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \Cref{part:project} comprises the project thesis.
\item \Cref{part:master} comprises the master thesis and builds upon the work of \cref{part:project}.
\item \Cref{part:appendices} comprises appendices for both \cref{part:project} and \cref{part:master}.
\end{enumerate}
During evaluation, only the contents of \cref{part:master} and the appendices in \cref{part:appendices} it refers to should be considered part of the master thesis.
Use of results from \cref{part:project} in \cref{part:master} are accompanied by references and short summaries, so that the parts are intended to be read separately.
\end{tcolorbox}
