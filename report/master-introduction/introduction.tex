In \cref{chap:intro} and \cref{fig:intro:star_evolution} we reviewed how the currently known life cycle of a star
is more or less predetermined by the initial mass $M_0$ of the embryonic \textbf{protostar} that is born from its parent \textbf{giant molecular cloud}.
Provided that $M_0 \gtrsim 0.08 M_\odot$, the temperature in a protostar reaches the point necessary to ignite fusion of hydrogen, and the star becomes a \textbf{main-sequence star} -- otherwise it retires early as a \textbf{brown dwarf}.
If $0.08 M_\odot \lesssim M_0 \lesssim 8 M_\odot$, a main-sequence star eventually explodes in a \textbf{planetary nebula} and leaves behind a core that collapses under gravity until it stabilizes as a \textbf{white dwarf} (\cref{fig:master_intro:star_evolution_white_dwarf}) supported by the electron degeneracy pressure.
If $8 M_\odot \lesssim M_0 \lesssim 40 M_\odot$, a main-sequence star instead explodes in a \textbf{supernova} and becomes a \textbf{neutron star} (\cref{fig:master_intro:star_evolution_neutron_star}) that is squeezed by gravity beyond the maximum supported pressure of white dwarfs, reaching a new equilibrium mainly supported by the degeneracy pressure of baryons.
If $M_0 \gtrsim 40 M_\odot$, the supernova remnant cannot support itself and collapses under gravity to a \textbf{black hole} (\cref{fig:master_intro:star_evolution_black_hole}).

As proposed by \cite{ref:quark_star_proposition_1,ref:quark_star_proposition_2},
the density in the cores of the heaviest neutron stars on brink of collapse to black holes could be so high 
that baryons break up into deconfined quark matter.
Neutron stars with such quark cores are called \textbf{hybrid (neutron) stars} (\cref{fig:master_intro:star_evolution_neutron_star}).
Moreover, \textbf{(strange) quark stars} (\cref{fig:master_intro:star_evolution_quark_star}) consisting \emph{only} of (strange) quark matter could exist.
While two-flavor quark matter decays to hadronic matter and \emph{cannot} be realized in pure quark stars,
the \emph{strange matter hypothesis} of \cite{ref:strange_hypothesis_bodmer,ref:strange_hypothesis_witten} suggests that
hadronic matter could be only a long-lived \emph{metastable} state and that its true ground state is three-flavor quark matter,
which \emph{could} make up stable pure quark stars
with extremely sharp surfaces. \cite{ref:glendenning}

As explained in greater detail in \cref{sec:intro:pulsars},
all observed neutron stars are identified by radiation emitted from rapidly spinning \textbf{pulsa}ting \textbf{r}adio (\textbf{pulsar} or \textbf{PSR}) sources.
Based only on such measurements, it is difficult to determine the precise composition of the sources and whether they are neutron stars, hybrid stars or strange quark stars.
The recent observations \cite{ref:antoniadis,ref:arzoumanian,ref:fonseca}
of the heavy pulsars PSR J0348$+$0432, PSR J1614$-$2230 and PSR J0740$+$6620
with masses $M = \{2.01 \pm 0.04, 1.91 \pm 0.02, 2.08 \pm 0.07\} \, M_\odot$ 
suggest that neutron stars could indeed reach sufficient densities for the formation of quark cores in hybrid stars.
Observed candidates for strange quark stars include
RX J185635$-$3754 \cite{ref:RXJ1856}, 
3C58 \cite{ref:3c58}, 
ASASSN$-$15lh \cite{ref:ASASSN}, 
PSR B0943$+$10 \cite{ref:PSRB0943}
and the yet undiscovered SN1987A remnant \cite{ref:SN1987A_1,ref:SN1987A_2}.
In particular, if a pulsar with a sub-millisecond rotation period is observed,
it would strongly suggest the existence of strange quark stars. \cite{ref:glendenning} % sec 10.3 (PDF)

Quarks and the mediators of the strong force between them -- gluons -- are described by the theory of \textbf{quantum chromodynamics}.
Very roughly speaking, it predicts that quarks are confined in hadrons at low temperatures and densities due to a property called \textbf{color confinement},
but deconfined and free of all interactions at high temperatures or densities because of another property called \textbf{asymptotic freedom}.
In addition to the confinement transition, quantum chromodynamics exhibits a \textbf{chiral transition}.
Unfortunately, it is very hard to work analytically with the general theory of quantum chromodynamics,
so one must turn to approximations and models.
We will model quark and hybrid stars using the quark-meson model;
elaborating, complementing and building upon earlier work by \cite{ref:master_berge}.

\section{\texorpdfstring{\textls[-27]{The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and stellar stability}}{The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation and stellar stability}}
\label{sec:master_intro:tov}

The structure of a spherically symmetric star is governed by the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\odv{P}{r} &= -\frac{G m \epsilon(P)}{r^2 c^2} \left( 1 + \frac{P}{\epsilon(P)} \right) \left( 1 + \frac{4 \pi r^3 P}{m c^2} \right) \left( 1 - \frac{2 G m}{r c^2} \right)^{-1} , \\
	\odv{m}{r} &= \frac{4 \pi r^2 \epsilon(P)}{c^2} .
\end{align}%
\label{eq:master_intro:tov}%
\end{subequations}%
It is a system of two differential equations for the energy density $\epsilon(r)$, pressure $P(r)$ and cumulative mass $m(r)$ as functions of the radius $r$ from the center of the star assumed to be composed of a perfect fluid in hydrostatic equilibrium.
We derived it from the Einstein field equations \eqref{eq:einstein} and studied it in detail in \cref{chap:tov}.
It therefore includes relativistic corrections, which is particularly important for compact stars with high density.

To solve it, one must know the \textbf{equation of state} $\epsilon(P)$ that connects the fluid's pressure and energy density,
thereby closing the system of three equations and three unknowns.
It can then be integrated from the center $r=0$ with zero initial mass $m(0) = 0$ and some central pressure $P(0) = P_c$ until reaching the surface $r=R$ defined by a vanishing pressure $P(R) = 0$.
This yields the radial profiles $\epsilon(r)$, $P(r)$ and $m(r)$, and the total mass $M = m(R)$ can then be calculated.
Thus, one chosen central pressure $P_c$ corresponds to one star with a resulting mass $M$ and radius $R$.
As the central pressure is unknown,
it is common to parametrize a sequence of stars with a range of central pressures,
solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation for each of them
and draw a curve connecting their masses and radii in a mass-radius diagram.

In \cref{sec:nstars:numtov} we wrote a program that integrates the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation for an arbitrary equation of state and generates a smooth mass-radius curve between two given central pressures.
We will feed this machine with all equations of state that we encounter.

We drew a mass-radius curve for ideal neutron stars in \cref{fig:nstars:massradius}.
As the central pressure increases,
the mass also increases up to some maximum,
and then decreases as the curve enters a counterclockwise spiral.
In \cref{sec:nstars:stability_general} we studied the stability of stars along this curve in detail,
and found that only the stars on the mass-increasing segment up to the maximum are stable and realized in nature.
This common property of mass-radius curves is the reason that we will focus our attention on the maximum mass and the part of the curve leading up to it.

\section{Thermal field theory in compact stars}
\label{sec:master_intro:tft}

To derive equations of state for quark matter, we will study quantum field theories whose dynamics is described by some Lagrangian density $\lagr$.
In \cref{chap:tft} we showed that the partition function in the grand canonical ensemble corresponding to a Lagrangian including both a fermionic Grassmann field $\psi$ and a bosonic scalar field $\phi$ is given by the path integral
\begin{equation}
	Z(V, T, \mu_i) = \oint_- \pathintdif \bar{\psi} \oint_- \pathintdif \psi \oint_+ \pathintdif \phi \exp \bigg\{ \int_0^\beta \dif \tau \int_V \dif^3 x \, \Big( \lagr_E\big[\bar{\psi}, \psi, \phi\big] + \sum_i \mu_i j^0_i \Big) \bigg\}.
\label{eq:master_intro:partition_function}
\end{equation}
Here it is the Euclidean Lagrangian density $\lagr_E$ that enters,
obtained from the original Lagrangian $\lagr$ in Minkowski space by substituting an imaginary time variable $t = -i \tau$ into all the fields and then treating $\tau$ as the new ``time'' variable.
The volume of the system is $V$, while its ``temporal'' extent is the system's inverse temperature $\beta = 1/T$.
Sign subscripts are placed on closed path integral signs to remind us of an important property that we showed: bosonic fields must be \emph{periodic} in inverse temperature time, while fermionic fields must be \emph{anti-periodic}.
We also saw that we could couple any conserved Noether charge densities $j^0_i$ arising from symmetries of the Lagrangian to chemical potentials $\mu_i$.

After computing (the logarithm of) the partition function, it is straightforward to find the grand potential (density)
\begin{equation}
	\Omega(T, \mu_i) = -\frac{\log Z}{\beta V}
	\qquad \text{from} \qquad
	Z = e^{-\beta V \Omega} .
\label{eq:master_intro:grand_potential}
\end{equation}
The volume dependence of the partition function is eliminated by division, turning the extensive quantity $\log Z$ into the intensive quantity $\Omega$.
From the grand potential density, we can calculate the relevant thermodynamic quantities:
\cite[section 4.9]{ref:kardar}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	\text{pressure} \quad P(T, \mu_i) &= -\Omega, \label{eq:master_intro:pressure} \\
	\text{number densities} \quad n_i(T, \mu_i) &= -\pdv{\Omega}{\mu_i}, \label{eq:master_intro:densities} \\
	\text{entropy density} \quad s(T, \mu_i) &= -\pdv{\Omega}{T} = \beta^2 \pdv{\Omega}{\beta}, \label{eq:master_intro:entropy} \\
	\text{energy density} \quad \epsilon(T, \mu_i) &= \sum_i \mu_i n_i + \pdv{(\beta \Omega)}{\beta} = \sum_i \mu_i n_i - P + T s. \label{eq:master_intro:energy_density}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Our goal is to connect a given pressure $P$ to some energy density $\epsilon$, so we can solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation \eqref{eq:master_intro:tov}.
This is greatly simplified in compact stars, where it is common to employ the \textbf{zero-temperature approximation} $T=0$.
We justified this approximation for neutron stars in \cref{sec:nstars:eos} due to the temperature being far lower than the Fermi temperature $T_f$.
With $T = 0$, only the dependence on the chemical potentials remains in
\begin{equation}
	P(\mu_i) = -\Omega
	\qquad \text{and} \qquad
	\epsilon(\mu_i) = \sum_i \mu_i n_i - P.
\end{equation}
If there is only one chemical potential $\mu_i = \mu$,
the equation of state $\epsilon(P)$ follows by simply eliminating $\mu$ from $P(\mu)$ and $\epsilon(\mu)$, either numerically or analytically.
This was the case for the neutron star equation of state \eqref{eq:nstars:gr_eos}.
In contrast, the stars we will study now will be composed of up quarks, down quarks, strange quarks and electrons, each associated with a chemical potential.
We then need \emph{three} additional relations to constrain the \emph{four} chemical potentials to \emph{one} independent one, which can then be eliminated to give the equation of state.

\subsection*{Chemical equilibrium of weak interaction processes}

We can find two relations between the chemical potentials by assuming that the nuclear processes in the star are in chemical equilibrium.
According to \cite{ref:quark_star_processes}, quark stars may be formed as hadronic matter in a neutron star decays to quark matter through \textbf{Urca processes}%
\footnote{%
	\textbf{Urca processes} are a general class of processes that emit neutrinos and cool neutron stars.
	Their discoverers George Gamow and Mário Schenberg met at the famous Casino de Urca in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil,
	where they ``called it the Urca Process, partially to commemorate the casino in
	which we first met, and partially because the Urca Process
	results in a rapid disappearance of thermal energy from
	the interior of a star, similar to the rapid disappearance of
	money from the pockets of the gamblers on the Casino da
	Urca.'' \cite{ref:urca}
}
like
\begin{equation}
u + e^- \rightarrow d + \nu_e
\quad\qquad \text{and} \quad\qquad
u + e^- \rightarrow s + \nu_e .
\end{equation}
Over time, neutrinos are emitted from the star, thereby cooling it.
Setting $\mu_{\nu_e}=0$, chemical equilibrium of these two processes implies the two independent \textbf{$\beta$-equilibrium} relations
\begin{equation}
\mu_u + \mu_e = \mu_d = \mu_s .
\label{eq:lsm:chemical_equilibrium}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{Electric charge neutrality}

The third and last relation between the four chemical potentials is provided by electric charge neutrality.
By comparing Newton's law of gravity and Coulomb's law of electrostatics,
we can make a simple classical argument for why there can be no \emph{global} net electric charge in stars.

Suppose a test particle with mass $m$ and electric charge $q$
is placed on the surface $R$ of a star with total mass $M$ and electric charge $Q$.
In an idealized situation where the test particle is affected only by the gravitational and electrostatic forces,
the total outwards force on it is
\begin{equation}
F_\text{out} = -G \frac{M m}{R^2} + k_e \frac{Q q}{R^2} .
\end{equation}
If the star and test particle have opposite charges, $F_\text{out} < 0$ and the star binds the particle and picks up any other particles with opposite charge, seeking to neutralize itself.
However, if they have like charges, $F_\text{out} > 0$ \emph{provided that}
\begin{equation}
\frac{Q}{M} > \frac{G}{k_e} \, \frac{m}{q}.
\end{equation}
In other words, particles leave and neutralize the star until the left side has descended to the constant right side.
Even for a heavy baryon like a proton with mass $m = \SI{1.67e-27}{\kilogram}$ and charge $q = +e$ in a common compact star of about one solar mass $M \approx M_\odot$,
the star emits particles until it has practically zero net electric charge
\begin{equation}
Q \lesssim 10^{-10} e .
\end{equation}

In a star that consists of different particle species with charges $q_i$,
we could implement \emph{global} neutrality by constraining the chemical potentials $\mu_i(r)$ at every radius $r$ such that the charge density
\begin{equation}
	\sum_i q_i \, n_i(\mu_i(r)) = \rho(r)
\label{eq:intro:charge_neutrality_global}
\end{equation}
fits some profile $\rho(r)$ that
integrates to a vanishing total charge $Q = \int_0^R \rho(r) 4 \pi r^2 \dif r = 0$.
This approach would make the equation of state $\epsilon(P)$ at one radius $r$ dependent on its value at \emph{all radii},
and it is not obvious how one should single out one of the infinitely many possible charge density profiles $\rho(r)$.
We will avoid this problem altogether by rather assuming that charge neutrality holds \emph{locally} with $\rho(r) = 0$,
eliminating the chemical potentials at any radius according to
\begin{equation}
	\sum_i q_i \, n_i(\mu_i) = 0
\label{eq:lsm:charge_neutrality}
\end{equation}
As shown in \cite{ref:global_neutrality}, for example, the stronger assumption of local charge neutrality can in fact modify masses and radii of stars within an order of magnitude of solar masses,
but the differences become smaller as one approaches the maximum mass star.
Our choice $\rho(r)=0$ is therefore the simplest choice, but not necessarily the most accurate and physical one.

The three relations \eqref{eq:lsm:chemical_equilibrium} and \eqref{eq:lsm:charge_neutrality}
constrain the four chemical potentials $\mu_u$, $\mu_d$, $\mu_s$ and $\mu_e$
to a single one that is eliminated from $P(\mu_i)$ and $\epsilon(\mu_i)$
to yield the equation of state $\epsilon(P)$.

The theory of the strong interaction force is called \textbf{quantum chromodynamics} (\textbf{QCD}).
It describes the interaction between quarks mediated by gluons through the Lagrangian density
\begin{equation}
	\lagr = \bar{q} ( i \gamma^\mu D_\mu - m ) q - \frac14 G_{\mu\nu}^a G^{\mu\nu}_a
	\qquad \text{with} \qquad
	G_{\mu\nu}^a = \partial_\mu A_\nu^a - \partial_\nu A_\mu^a + g f^{abc} A_\mu^b A_\nu^c.
\label{eq:qcd:lagrangian}
\end{equation}
In general,
the quark fields $q = q_{f,c,\alpha}(x)$ are indexed by
the $N_f = 6$ flavors $f \in \{u,d,s,c,b,t\}$,
the $N_c = 3$ colors $c \in \{r,g,b\}$ and
$4$ Dirac spinor indices $\alpha \in \{0,1,2,3\}$.
We will take a flavor index with the shorthand $f = q_{f,c,\alpha}(x)$.
The gamma matrices \eqref{eq:tft:gamma_dirac_basis} (in the Dirac basis) act in spinor space,
the mass matrix $m = \diag(m_u, m_d, m_s, m_c, m_b, m_t)$ in flavor space,
and there are suppressed identity matrices in spinor, flavor and color space wherever needed for the Lagrangian to be a scalar.
The covariant derivative is $D_\mu = \partial_\mu - i g A_\mu^a T^a$ and couples the gluon gauge fields $A_\mu^a$ to the quarks with strength $g$.
Finally, $T^a$ are the $\smash{N_f^2} - 1$ generators of the symmetry group $SU(N_f)$.
They are conventionally normalized to $\trace[T^a T^b] = \delta^{ab}/2$,
and their structure constants $f^{abc}$ can be determined from the commutators $\comm{T^a}{T^b} = i f^{abc} T^c$.

QCD can be viewed as a generalization of quantum electrodynamics (QED),
where there is a single electron in place of multiple quarks and photons play the role of gluons.
QED is a simpler \emph{Abelian} gauge theory with symmetry group $U(1)$,
whereas QCD is a \emph{non-Abelian} gauge theory with symmetry group $SU(N_f)$ and an example of a Yang-Mills theory.

The heaviest \textbf{c}harm, \textbf{b}ottom and \textbf{t}op quarks only appear at extreme energies.
In ``practical applications'' only the $N_f=3$ lightest \textbf{u}p, \textbf{d}own and \textbf{s}trange flavors are needed.
Their $SU(3)$ generators $T^a$ are the \emph{Gell-Mann matrices},
and their main properties are listed in \cref{tab:qcd:quark_properties}.

\subsection*{Phase diagram and calculational methods}
%\label{sec:qcd:phase_diagram_and_methods}

The phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics describes the phase of quark matter
as a function of temperature $T$ and the common quark, isospin and strangeness chemical potentials
\begin{equation}
	\mu   = \frac12 \big( \mu_u + \mu_d \big), \qquad
	\mu_I = \frac12 \big( \mu_u - \mu_d \big), \qquad
	\mu_S = \frac12 \big( \mu_u - \mu_d \big) - \mu_s.
\label{eq:master_intro:chemical_potentials_transformed}
\end{equation}
Inverting these relations for the individual quark chemical potentials give
\begin{equation}
	\mu_u = \mu + \mu_I, \qquad
	\mu_d = \mu - \mu_I, \qquad
	\mu_s = \mu - \mu_S .
\label{eq:master_intro:chemical_potentials_particles}
\end{equation}
By applying the chain rule to the density \eqref{eq:master_intro:densities},
we can derive that the suitably named common quark chemical potential $\mu=\mu(\mu_u,\mu_d,\mu_s)$ corresponds to the total quark density
\begin{equation}
	n = -\pdv{\Omega}{\mu} =
	-\pdv{\Omega}{\mu_u} \pdv{\mu_u}{\mu}
	-\pdv{\Omega}{\mu_d} \pdv{\mu_d}{\mu}
	-\pdv{\Omega}{\mu_s} \pdv{\mu_s}{\mu} =
	n_u + n_d + n_s.
\end{equation}
Some authors rather prefer to talk about the baryon chemical potential $\mu_B = 3 \mu$ and the baryon density $n_B = n / 3$.
Although mapping out the phase diagram is an active area of research, a rough qualitative picture is known, and the $\mu_B$-$T$-slice with $\mu_I = \mu_S = 0$ is shown in \cref{fig:qcd:phase_diagram}.
In compact stars we have already argued that it is a good approximation to set $T=0$,
and we will later see that the chemical potential constraints \eqref{eq:lsm:chemical_equilibrium} and \eqref{eq:lsm:charge_neutrality}
parametrizes a curve for the state of charge-neutral quark matter in $\beta$-equilibrium that lies close to the $\mu$-axis.
We will shortly discuss the most important qualitative properties of quantum chromodynamics and relate them to this phase diagram.

The general theory of quantum chromodynamics is notorious for being very difficult to work with,
and its elegance and practicality stops not long after writing down its Lagrangian \eqref{eq:qcd:lagrangian}.
To explore the phase diagram, one must therefore turn to alternative techniques:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Perturbation theory} can be used to study quantum chromodynamics analytically at \emph{high} energy, perhaps contrary to what one might expect.
      As we will soon discuss in more detail, this is due to an unintuitive property called asymptotic freedom that causes the interaction strength to \emph{decrease} with increasing energy, or decreasing distances.
\item \textbf{Lattice QCD} consists of discretizing spacetime to a lattice and making numerical field calculations on it.
      This method has proved very useful for studying quantum chromodynamics under quite general circumstances,
      but in the regime of high baryon density and low temperature it is plagued by the \emph{sign problem},
      referring to the difficulty of calculating integrals of highly oscillatory functions.
      This is precisely the region of the phase diagram that is relevant for compact stars.
\item The \textbf{$\bm{N_c}$ expansion} is a systematic scheme in which one makes expansions in the assumed small parameter $1/N_c$.
      Although there are only $N_c = 3$ colors in nature, this scheme is indeed widely used to gain insight into quantum chromodynamics and make predictions. \cite{ref:large_Nc_review}
      Specifically, sending $N_c \rightarrow \infty$ is referred to as the \textbf{large $\bm{N_c}$-limit}.
      We will refer to it to justify some of our later calculations.
\item \textbf{Effective theories and models} can be used to study quantum chromodynamics in some regimes of interest.
      The most important requirements of such a theory or model is that it includes the correct degrees of freedom (particles) and exhibits the same symmetries and symmetry breaking patterns as the theory it aims to describe in the targeted regime.
      Due to \cite{ref:weinberg_eft}, the philosophy is then to ``write down the most general possible theory involving fields for these particles, including all possible interactions consistent with the symmetries''.
      Chiral perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) is an example of an effective low-energy \emph{theory} obtained systematically in this way,
      and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and the quark-extended linear sigma model (LSM), also known as the quark-meson (QM) model, are effective \emph{models} in the same regime.
      This approach is applicable along the $\mu$-axis and hence in compact stars, and is the one we will take.
\end{itemize}

One fundamental feature of quantum chromodynamics is \textbf{color confinement}.
Quarks can be color-charged \textcolor{red}{\textbf{red}}, \textcolor{green}{\textbf{green}} and \textcolor{blue}{\textbf{blue}},
while antiquarks can have the complementary anticolors \textcolor{cyan}{\textbf{antired}}, \textcolor{magenta}{\textbf{antigreen}} and \textcolor{yellow}{\textbf{antiblue}}.
At low temperature and density, experiments and lattice simulations show that colored quarks never appear alone, but are always confined in ``white'' hadrons with no overall color.
As the distance between color-charged quarks increases, the strong force between them remains \emph{constant} -- the quarks are  effectively ``glued'' together by mediating gluons.
For example, a meson consists of one quark of any color and one antiquark of its complementary color, making the meson itself colorless or ``white''.
Similarly, a(n) (anti)baryon consists of one (anti)red, one (anti)green and one (anti)blue quark and is also ``white''.
Such ``white'' bound states illustrated in \cref{fig:qcd:colorless_hadrons} are also referred to as color singlets.

What if you are even stronger than the strong force and attempt to forcibly separate the colorless quarks in a hadron to colorful groups of quarks?
Then nature will simply create new quark--anti-quark pairs so that the new groups of quarks both become new colorless hadrons,
shrug back at you and ask what your next move is.
At low temperatures and densities in the lower left of \cref{fig:qcd:phase_diagram}, quarks are therefore \emph{confined}
in nuclei that make up the present world around us.

In the opposite extreme of high temperature or density in \cref{fig:qcd:phase_diagram}, quantum chromodynamics exhibits the property of \textbf{asymptotic freedom}.
As the energy scale of quark interactions increases, or equivalently its length scale decreases, the interaction strength \emph{decreases} and quarks become \emph{deconfined}.
With high temperature, experiments and calculations have shown that the deconfined phase is a \textbf{quark-gluon plasma} of free color charges and gluons.
It is believed that the universe passed through this phase during the first $\SI{20}{\micro\second}$ after the Big Bang, after which it transitioned to the present phase of hadronic matter.
The situation with low temperature and high density is more uncertain:
no human-made laboratory can recreate the extreme densities required for quark matter to form and be studied experimentally.
On the theoretical side, calculations are difficult and done with separate models that suggest qualitatively different features.
Only in the extreme limit of infinite baryon density where perturbation theory applies,
it is known that the deconfined phase turns into a \textbf{color-flavor-locked phase} of superconducting color charges. \cite{ref:qcd_phase_diagram_dense}
Asymptotic freedom was first discovered by \cite{ref:asymptotic_freedom_gross_wilczek,ref:asymptotic_freedom_politzer}, who were recognized with the Nobel Prize in 2004.

The \emph{Polyakov loop} is an approximate order parameter of confinement in quantum chromodynamics.
We will model quark stars that consist of deconfined quark matter,
but there also exist effective models that take the Polyakov loop and confinement into account
-- see for example \cite{ref:master_folkestad} for an introduction.

%As the temperature increases, confined hadronic quark matter turns into a \emph{deconfined} \textbf{quark-gluon plasma} in the upper right of \cref{fig:qcd:phase_diagram} where they are free of all interactions and move around at will.
%It is believed that the universe passed through this phase during the first $\SI{20}{\micro\second}$ after the Big Bang, after which it transitioned to the present phase of hadronic matter.
%As no human-made laboratory can possibly recreate the necessary densities in the near future, the best candidates for finding and studying this exotic state of matter today is precisely the cores of compact stars.
%Asymptotic freedom was first discovered by \cite{ref:asymptotic_freedom_gross_wilczek,ref:asymptotic_freedom_politzer}, who were recognized with the Nobel Prize in 2004.

\subsection*{Vector, axial and chiral symmetries and chiral symmetry breaking}
%\label{sec:qcd:symmetry}

The Lagrangian \eqref{eq:qcd:lagrangian} has some interesting global symmetries, each of which gives rise to a conserved classical current by Noether's theorem.
The simplest symmetry is the $U(1)_V$ \textbf{vector symmetry} $q \rightarrow e^{i \theta} q$, giving rise to the conserved vector current $j^\mu = \bar{q} \gamma^\mu q$ representing quark number densities.
In the grand canonical ensemble, we will later couple one such conserved current to a chemical potential for each quark flavor.
In the massless case $m = 0$, the Lagrangian also has the $U(1)_A$ \textbf{axial symmetry} $q \rightarrow e^{i \theta \gamma^5} q$ with the conserved axial current $j^\mu = \bar{q} \gamma^\mu \gamma^5 q$.

As its proof assumes the action to be extremized, Noether's theorem is inherently \emph{classical}.
Unlike the vector current, the axial current is in fact no longer conserved as one takes quantum effects into account,
and it is therefore said to be \emph{anomalous}.
\cite[equation (28.20)]{ref:schwartz}
%\cite[chapter 3]{ref:lsm_notes}

Using the projection operator $P_\pm = \frac12 (1 \pm \gamma^5)$, we can introduce the left-handed ($-$) and right-handed ($+$) chiral fields $q_\pm = P_\pm q$.
One can then show that $q = q_- + q_+$, $\bar{q}_\pm q_\pm = 0$ and $\bar{q}_\pm \gamma^\mu D_\mu q_\mp = 0$, so that the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:qcd:lagrangian} can be written
\begin{equation}
	\lagr = \bar{q}_- i \gamma^\mu D_\mu q_- + \bar{q}_+ i \gamma^\mu D_\mu q_+ - \bar{q}_- m q_+ - \bar{q}_+ m q_- - \frac14 G_{\mu\nu}^a G^{\mu\nu}_a.
\label{eq:qcd:lagrangian_chiral}
\end{equation}
In the massless case $m=0$,
it is invariant under the $SU(N_f)_L \times SU(N_f)_R$ \textbf{chiral symmetry} transformation $q_\pm \rightarrow U_\pm q_\pm$ where both $U_\pm \in SU(N_f)$.
Moreover, it is known that the ground state of quantum chromodynamics admits a nonzero quark condensate \cite[chapter 28]{ref:schwartz}
\begin{equation}
	\avg{\bar{q} q} %= \avg{\bar{q}_- q_-} + \avg{\bar{q}_+ q_+} + \avg{\bar{q}_- q_+} + \avg{\bar{q}_+ q_-}
	                                                            = \avg{\bar{q}_- q_+} + \avg{\bar{q}_+ q_-},
\label{eq:qcd:condensate}
\end{equation}
but this is generally \emph{not} invariant under the chiral transformation.
The fact that the ground state does not carry the same symmetry as its governing Lagrangian is the signature of \textbf{spontaneous symmetry breaking}.
Only if $U_- = U_+$ is the condensate \eqref{eq:qcd:condensate} invariant -- this is a $SU(N_f)_V$ vector symmetry where both left-handed and right-handed fields are transformed in the same way.
This is also a symmetry of the \emph{massive} Lagrangian \eqref{eq:qcd:lagrangian_chiral} \emph{if} all quark masses are set equal so that the mass matrix $m$ is proportional to the identity matrix.
We therefore say that quantum chromodynamics exhibits \textbf{chiral symmetry breaking}
\begin{equation}
	SU(N_f)_L \times SU(N_f)_R \quad (m = 0) \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad SU(N_f)_V \quad (m \neq 0).
\label{eq:qcd:symmetry_breaking_pattern}
\end{equation}
Goldstone's theorem then predicts that one massless Goldstone boson arises from every broken symmetry generator.
Hence, chiral symmetry breaking gives rise to $2 \times (\smash{N_f^2} - 1) - (\smash{N_f^2} - 1) = \smash{N_f^2} - 1$ Goldstone bosons.
With $N_f = 2$ and $N_f = 3$ flavors, these are the three pions and the eight pseudoscalar mesons.

In the real world, however, the quarks have different masses and chiral symmetry is only \emph{approximately} broken.
We say that the different quark masses cause \textbf{explicit symmetry breaking}, in the sense that the Lagrangian changes by a small amount under the chiral transformation.
The physical consequence of this is that there are no massless Goldstone bosons, but rather very light pseudo-Goldstone bosons.

The breaking of chiral symmetry leads to the \textbf{chiral phase transition} shown in \cref{fig:qcd:phase_diagram}.
It follows the transition between confined and deconfined quark matter only to some extent. \TODO{correct?}
It is analogous to the phase transition and spontaneous symmetry breaking in a paramagnet described with the Ising model,
where an external magnetic field $B$ explicitly breaks the symmetry of spin orientations encapsulated in the order parameter of the magnetization $M$,
just like the quark masses $m$ explicitly breaks chiral symmetry encapsulated in the order parameter of the quark condensate $\avg{\bar{q} q}$.
