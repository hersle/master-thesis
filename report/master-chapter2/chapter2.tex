\chapter{The Two-Flavor Quark-Meson Model}
\label{chap:lsm2f}

At low energy the effective degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics are not individual quarks,
but baryons composed of up and down quarks and the three pions that we saw arose from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking pattern \eqref{eq:qcd:symmetry_breaking_pattern}.
The MIT bag model that we discussed in \cref{chap:mit} modeled quark stars as a deconfined Fermi gas of quarks with a bag constant $B$.
We will now crank up the difficulty and investigate the \textbf{linear sigma model}, which also takes chiral symmetry breaking and the pions into account by introducing an ``ad--hoc'' $\sigma$ particle.
The linear sigma model was originally introduced by \cite{ref:lsm_original} as an effective model for nucleons interacting with pions and scalar mesons,
but the fermions have since been interpreted as quarks in what is commonly referred to as a \textbf{quark-meson model}.

We will take the quark-meson model as granted.
As it combines \emph{independent} quarks and mesons,
the latter of which are fundamentally bound quark states,
it may appear strange.
A hypothetical first-principles approach from quantum chromodynamics
would naturally give rise to hadrons by binding quarks with gluons.
We cannot expect this from an effective model that excludes the gluons,
in a sense trading the binding \emph{mechanism} with the bound \emph{product}.
It is not our primary concern here to give a full physical justification of the model,
but we will justify it to some extent by seeing how it gives rise to chiral symmetry breaking.
To better understand its theoretical origin, we recommend studying \cite{ref:master_resch,ref:master_folkestad,ref:lsm_notes}.

Quark stars consisting only of two-flavor quark matter are unlikely to be found in nature,
as two-flavor quark matter is observed to be unstable compared to hadronic matter.
Nevertheless, they are a natural stepping stone for modeling possibly stable strange quark stars
and dense hybrid neutron stars whose core could contain two-flavor quark matter.

\section{Lagrangian, vacuum and symmetries}
\label{sec:lsm:vacuum}

The Lagrangian density for the linear sigma model coupled to quarks is \cite{ref:lsm_2f}
\begin{equation}
	\lagr = \bar{q} \Big[ i \slashed\partial + \mu \gamma^0 - g \big( \sigma + i \gamma^5 \vec\tau \cdot \vec\pi \big) \Big] q
	      + \frac12 \Big[ \big( \partial_\mu \sigma \big) \big( \partial^\mu \sigma \big) + \big( \partial_\mu \vec\pi \big) \big( \partial^\mu \vec\pi \big) \Big] - \pot(\sigma,\vec\pi)
\label{eq:lsm:lagrangian}
\end{equation}
with the meson potential
\begin{equation}
	\pot(\sigma, \vec\pi) = \frac{m^2}{2} \big( \sigma^2 + \vec\pi^2 \big) + \frac{\lambda}{4!} \big( \sigma^2 + \vec\pi^2 \big)^2 - h \sigma .
\label{eq:lsm:potential}
\end{equation}
The quarks $q$ behave as in the QCD Lagrangian \eqref{eq:qcd:lagrangian} with $N_f=2$ flavor indices $\{u,d\}$, $N_c=3$ color indices and four Dirac spinor indices.
They are coupled to two quark chemical potentials $\mu = \diag (\mu_u, \mu_d)$ in flavor space,
but are now seemingly massless and coupled to a $\sigma$ meson and three pions $\vec\pi = [\pi^+, \pi^-, \pi^0]^\mathsf{T}$ with a Yukawa coupling $g$ and the Pauli matrices \eqref{eq:tft:pauli_matrices}.
The meson potential features three couplings $m^2<0$, $\lambda>0$ and $h>0$.

\pagebreak
Like quantum chromodynamics, the quark-meson model Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian} has the vector $U(1)_V$ and the axial $U(1)_A$ symmetry shown in \cref{sec:master_intro:qcd}.
But how does the quark-meson model give rise to the chiral symmetry breaking of quantum chromodynamics?

First, express the Yukawa coupling with right-handed and left-handed chiral fields $q_\pm = P_\pm q$:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\bar{q} \big[\sigma + i \gamma^5 \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{\pi}\big] q &= \bar{q} \big[ (P_+ + P_-) \sigma + (P_+ - P_-) i \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{\pi}\big] q && \; \big( P_\pm = \tfrac{1}{2} (1 \pm \gamma^5) \big) \\
	                                                           %&= \bar{q} \big[ P_+ (\sigma + i \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{\pi}) + P_- (\sigma - i \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{\pi}) \big] q && \; \big( \text{distributivity} \big)\\
	                                                           &= \bar{q} \big[ P_+ \phi + P_- \phi^\dagger\big] q && \; \big( \text{define } \phi=\sigma+i\vec{\tau}\cdot\vec{\pi} \big) \\
	                                                           %&= \bar{q} \big[ P_+^2 \phi + P_-^2 \phi^\dagger\big] q && \; \big( \text{$P_\pm=P_\pm^2$ lives in spinor-space} \big) \\
	                                                           &= \bar{q} \big[ P_+ \phi + P_- \phi^\dagger\big] \big[ P_+ + P_- \big] q && \; \big( P_+ + P_- = 1 \big) \\
	                                                           &= \bar{q} \big[ P_+ \phi P_+ + P_- \phi^\dagger P_-\big] q && \; \big( \text{$P_\pm P_\mp = 0$} \big)\\
	                                                           &= \bar{q}_- \phi \, q_+ + \bar{q}_+ \phi^\dagger q_- && \; \big( \text{$P_\pm q = q_\pm$, $\bar{q} P_\pm = \bar{q}_\mp$} \big).\\
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:lsm:yukawa_symmetry}
\end{equation}
Second, note that the meson potential \eqref{eq:lsm:potential} with $h=0$ only depends on the flavor-space trace
\begin{equation}
	\tfrac12 \trace\big[\phi^\dagger \phi\big] = \tfrac12 \big( \underbrace{\trace\big[1\big]}_2 \sigma^2 - i^2 \underbrace{\trace\big[\tau_a \tau_b \big]}_{2 \delta_{ab}} \pi_a \pi_b \big) = \sigma^2 + \vec{\pi}^2.
\label{eq:lsm:meson_symmetry}
\end{equation}
Under the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ transformation 
\begin{equation}
	%q_+ \rightarrow U_+ q_+, \qquad
	%q_- \rightarrow U_- q_-
	q_\pm \rightarrow U_\pm q_\pm
	\qquad \text{and} \qquad
	\phi   \rightarrow U_- \phi U_+^\dagger,
\label{eq:lsm:symmetry_transformation}
\end{equation}
the Yukawa interaction \eqref{eq:lsm:yukawa_symmetry},
the meson potential argument \eqref{eq:lsm:meson_symmetry}
and hence the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian} are invariant when $U_-=U_+$,
similarly to quantum chromodynamics.
This shows that in the absence of the parameter $h$,
the quark-meson model has $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ symmetry in the vacuum.

Since the group $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ is isomorphic to $O(4)$,
the symmetry can equivalently be understood by considering the meson fields as a four-vector $[\sigma, \vec{\pi}]^\mathsf{T}$
and noting that the meson potential \eqref{eq:lsm:potential} with $h=0$ is invariant under rotation of this vector in four-space.

Is this symmetry also spontaneously broken in the vacuum, like in quantum chromodynamics?
In the vacuum, the fermions do not contribute to the grand potential,
and the ground state values $\sigma = \avg{\sigma}$ and $\vec{\pi} = \avg{\vec{\pi}}$
are given by minima of the meson potential $\pot(\avg{\sigma},\avg{\vec{\pi}})$ illustrated in \cref{fig:lsm:potential}.
From its definition \eqref{eq:lsm:potential},
we see that they are given by
\begin{equation}
	%\vec{\pi} = \avg{\vec{\pi}}
	%\quad \text{and} \quad
	%\sigma = \avg{\sigma}
	%\pdv{\pot}{\sigma}_{(\sigma,\vec\pi)=(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0})} = m^2 \avg{\sigma} + \frac{\lambda}{6} \avg{\sigma}^3 - h = 0.
	\pdv{\pot}{\pi_a} = \avg{\pi_a} \Big[ m^2 + \frac{\lambda}{6} \big(\avg{\sigma}^2 + \avg{\vec{\pi}}^2\big) \Big] = 0
	\quad \text{and} \quad
	\pdv{\pot}{\sigma} = \avg{\sigma} \Big[ m^2 + \frac{\lambda}{6} \big(\avg{\sigma}^2 + \avg{\vec{\pi}}^2\big) \Big] - h = 0.
\label{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit}
\end{equation}
The qualitative nature of the solutions depends on whether $h$ vanishes:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the \textbf{chiral limit} $h=0$,
      the ground state solutions are a degenerate range of minima along the circle $\avg{\sigma}^2+\avg{\vec{\pi}}^2=-6m^2/\lambda$,
      sometimes referred to as a vacuum manifold.
      Without any loss of generality, we pick the one at $\avg{\sigma} = \sqrt{-6m^2/\lambda}>0$ and $\avg{\vec{\pi}}=0$.
\item At the \textbf{physical point} $h \neq 0$,
      the ground state of the potential is a unique global minimum at $\avg{\sigma} \neq 0$ and $\avg{\vec{\pi}}=0$ determined implicitly by equation \eqref{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit}.
\end{itemize}
Note how the oppositely signed parameters $m^2<0$ and $\lambda > 0$ are needed for the minimum $\avg{\sigma} = \sqrt{-6m^2/\lambda} \neq 0$ to exist,
and that $\avg{\vec{\pi}} = 0$ in both cases.
To account for quantum fluctuations $\tilde{\sigma}$ and $\tilde{\vec{\pi}}$ of $\sigma$ and $\vec{\pi}$ around the ground states $\avg{\sigma}$ and $\avg{\vec{\pi}}$,
let us write
\begin{equation}
	\sigma = \avg{\sigma} + \tilde{\sigma}
	\qquad \text{and} \qquad
	\vec\pi = \avg{\vec\pi} + \tilde{\vec{\pi}}.
\end{equation}
Up to second order in the quantum fluctuations,
the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian} becomes
\begin{equation}
	\lagr \taylor \smashoperator{\sum_{f=1}^{\smash{N_f}}} \smashoperator{\sum_{c=1}^{N_c}} \bar{q} \Big[ i \slashed\partial + \mu \gamma^0 - m_q \Big] q
	      +       \frac12 \Big[ \big( \partial_\mu \tilde{\sigma} \big) \big( \partial^\mu \tilde{\sigma} \big) + \big( \partial_\mu \tilde{\vec\pi} \big) \big( \partial^\mu \tilde{\vec\pi} \big) \Big] - \pot(\sigma,\vec\pi) , %\pot(\avg{\sigma}+\tilde{\sigma},\avg{\vec\pi}+\tilde{\vec\pi}) ,
\end{equation}
where the meson potential \eqref{eq:lsm:potential} to the same order is
\begin{equation}
	\pot(\sigma,\vec\pi) = \pot(\avg{\sigma},\avg{\vec\pi}) + h \tilde{\sigma} + \frac12 m_\sigma^2 \tilde{\sigma}^2 + \frac12 m_\pi^2 \tilde{\pi}^2.
\end{equation}
Here the quark and meson fields have acquired the effective masses
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	m_q &= g \avg{\sigma}, \label{eq:lsm:mass_quark} \\
	m_\sigma^2 &= \pdv[2]{\pot}{\sigma}\iffalse_{\substack{\sigma=\avg{\sigma}\\\vec{\pi}=\avg{\vec{\pi}}}}\fi    = m^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \avg{\sigma}^2 \equalexplabove{\smash[t]{\text{ by \eqref{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit} with $\avg{\vec{\pi}}=0$}}} \frac{3h}{\avg{\sigma}} - 2 m^2 , \label{eq:lsm:mass_sigma} \\
	m_\pi^2    &= \pdv[2]{\pot}{\vec{\pi}}\iffalse_{\substack{\sigma=\avg{\sigma}\\\vec{\pi}=\avg{\vec{\pi}}}}\fi = m^2 + \frac{\lambda}{6} \avg{\sigma}^2 \equalexplbelow{\smash[b]{\text{ by \eqref{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit} with $\avg{\vec{\pi}}=0$}}} \frac{h}{\avg{\sigma}} . \label{eq:lsm:mass_pi}
\end{align}%
\label{eq:lsm:mass_sigmapi}%
\end{subequations}%
Note that the up and down quarks share the degenerate mass $m_u = m_d = m_q$.
In nature isospin symmetry is only slightly broken, and the up and down quark masses are indeed almost equal.
The meson masses $m_\sigma$ and $m_\pi$ are called \emph{curvature masses}
due to their relation with the second derivative of the potential.
They coincide with the physical pole masses of the particles' propagators
only at tree level, where loop effects are neglected.

The qualitative nature of the pions depends on whether $h$ vanishes:
\begin{itemize}
\item In the \textbf{chiral limit} $h = 0$,
      the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ symmetry under the transformation \eqref{eq:lsm:symmetry_transformation} is exact,
      and we saw that there is a manifold of ground states.
      Upon committing to the minimum $\avg{\sigma} = \sqrt{-6m^2/\lambda} \neq 0$ and $\avg{\vec{\pi}} = 0$,
      the $O(4)$ rotation symmetry of the four original meson fields $[\sigma,\vec\pi]^\mathsf{T}$ is spontaneously broken
      to rotation of only the three pion quantum fluctuations $\vec{\pi} = \tilde{\vec\pi}$ in $O(3)$.
      Correspondingly, the pions are Goldstone bosons with vanishing masses \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_pi} associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.
\item At the \textbf{physical point} $h \neq 0$,
      the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ symmetry under the transformation \eqref{eq:lsm:symmetry_transformation} is explicitly broken,
      and we saw above that there is a unique ground state.
      Correspondingly, the pions are pseudo-Goldstone bosons with small masses \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_pi}.
\end{itemize}
\label{elaborate on mexican hat analogy, brim, tip/tilt, etc.}
Unlike the resulting massless pions, the $\sigma$ particle is the \emph{cause} of the symmetry breaking,
and there is no reason for its mass \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_sigma} to vanish.
Speaking brutally to get our point across, the $\sigma$ meson is merely a means to an end
to generate the chiral symmetry breaking and the pions,
which are our three favorite spoiled children in this group of four meson siblings.

To summarize: although the linear sigma model symmetry breaking pattern
\begin{equation}
	SU(2) \times SU(2) \simeq O(4) \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad O(3)
\end{equation}
is \emph{different} from the quantum chromodynamics symmetry breaking pattern \eqref{eq:qcd:symmetry_breaking_pattern} ``under the hood'',
they qualitatively give rise to the \emph{same} spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking and pion degrees of freedom ``on the outside''.
Practically speaking, the patterns are indistinguishable and equivalent.
According to Weinberg's philosophy presented in \cref{sec:master_intro:qcd},
the quark-meson model is thus an appropriate effective model of quantum chromodynamics at low energy.
The explicit symmetry breaker $h \neq 0$ only turns the exact symmetry into an approximate one,
just like the different quark masses explicitly break the chiral symmetry of quantum chromodynamics.
This is our physical justification of the quark-meson model.

\section{Grand potential}
\label{sec:lsm:grand_potential}

With our recently gained faith in the quark-meson model,
we set out to calculate its grand potential \eqref{eq:master_intro:grand_potential}.
With the quark fields $q$, the meson fields $\sigma$ and $\vec\pi$
and the coupling of conserved currents $j^\mu_f = \bar{q}_f \gamma^\mu q_f$ to chemical potentials $\mu$ already baked into the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian},
the partition function \eqref{eq:master_intro:partition_function} is
\begin{equation}
	Z = \oint_- \pathintdif \bar{q} \oint_- \pathintdif q \oint_+ \pathintdif \sigma \oint_+ \pathintdif \vec\pi \exp \left\{ \int_0^\beta \dif \tau \int_V \dif^3 x \, \lagr_E[\bar{q}, q, \sigma, \vec\pi]  \right\} .
\label{eq:lsm:partition_function_initial}
\end{equation}
To calculate it we will use the \textbf{mean-field approximation} for the bosonic fields,
replacing them by their \emph{yet unknown} expectation values $\avg{\sigma}$ and $\avg{\vec\pi}$ in the classical ground state
and simply ignoring their quantum fluctuations $\tilde{\sigma}$ and $\tilde{\vec\pi}$.
In contrast we will give the fermions full treatment,
motivated by their more dramatic behavior at zero temperature.
After calculating the grand potential with unknown mean fields,
their precise values are found \emph{self-consistently} with the original assumption of them being minima of the grand potential by solving
\begin{equation}
	\pdv{\Omega}{\avg{\sigma}} = \pdv{\Omega}{\avg{\vec\pi}} = 0.
\label{eq:lsm:gap_equation}
\end{equation}
We call this the \textbf{self-consistency equation} for the mean fields.
For example, the mean-field approximation is also famously used in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity to determine an energy gap.
There it is called the \textbf{gap equation}, 
and many authors continue to use this name as a relic even in other applications, such as this model.
%and it can be useful to know that this name lives on as a relic in completely different applications, too.

In our treatment we will also neglect pion condensation and assume that $\avg{\vec\pi}=0$ \emph{always} vanishes.
As shown by \cite{ref:jo_lsm_pion_condensation,ref:jo_lsm_consistent}, for example,
this is known to be true at $T=0$ when the isospin chemical potential \eqref{eq:master_intro:chemical_potentials_transformed} does not exceed half the pion mass.
This assumption is subject to a self-consistency check later.
It is then only $\avg{\sigma}$ that needs to be determined by the self-consistency equation \eqref{eq:lsm:gap_equation}.

With bosonic mean fields, the partition function \eqref{eq:lsm:partition_function_initial} with the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian} reads
\begin{equation}
	Z = \oint_- \pathintdif \bar{q} \! \oint_- \pathintdif q \exp \bigg\{ \int_0^{\beta} \dif \tau \int_V \dif^3 x \Big[ \bar{q} \big( i \slashed\partial + \mu \gamma^0 - m_q \big) q - \pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0}) \Big] \bigg\}.
\end{equation}
The meson potential is independent of the fields and can be pulled out of the integrals,
while the fermionic contribution decouples into a product of identical integrals.
We therefore have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	%\log Z &= -\frac12 \beta V m^2 \avg{\sigma}^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4!} \beta V \avg{\sigma}^4 + \beta V h \avg{\sigma} \\
	       %&+ \sum_{f=1}^{N_f} \sum_{c=1}^{N_c} \log \oint_- \pathintdif \bar{q}_f^c \oint_- \pathintdif q_f^c \exp \left\{ \int_0^\beta \dif \tau \int_V \dif^3 x \, \bar{q}_f^c (i \slashed\partial + \mu_f \gamma^0 - m_q) q_f^c \right\} .
	\log Z = -\beta V \, \pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0}) + \sum_{f=1}^{\smash{N_f}} \sum_{c=1}^{N_c} \log \oint_- \!\!\! \pathintdif \bar{q}_{f,c} \! \oint_- \!\!\! \pathintdif q_{f,c} \exp \bigg\{ \! \int_0^\beta \!\!\! \dif \tau \! \int_V \!\!\! \dif^3 x \, \bar{q}_{f,c} \big(i \slashed\partial \!+\! \mu_f \gamma^0 \!-\! m_f \big) q_{f,c} \! \bigg\} .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We have already calculated the path integral in the last term
from equation \eqref{eq:tft:dirac_partition_function_first} to equation \eqref{eq:tft:dirac_partition_function}.
As $q_{f,c}$ is integrated over, the color sum gives an additional factor $\sum_{c=1}^{N_c} = N_c$ because its summand is independent of $c$,
while the flavor sum $\sum_{f=1}^{\smash{N_f}}$ yields $N_f$ terms that differ only by the chemical potential $\mu_f$ associated with each flavor.
Thus, the grand potential \eqref{eq:master_intro:grand_potential} is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	%\log Z &= -\frac12 \beta V m^2 \avg{\sigma}^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4!} \beta V \avg{\sigma}^4 + \beta V h \avg{\sigma} \\
	       %&+ 2 V N_c \sum_{f=1}^{N_f} \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{(2 \pi)^3} \left\{ \beta E(\vec{p}) + \log \left[ e^{-\beta (E(\vec{p}) - \mu_f)}+1 \right] + \log \left[ e^{-\beta (E(\vec{p}) + \mu_f)} + 1\right] \right\} ,
	\Omega = \pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0}) - \frac{2 N_c}{\beta} \sum_{f=1}^{\smash{N_f}} \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{(2 \pi)^3} \left\{ \beta E(\vec{p}) + \log \left[ e^{-\beta (E(\vec{p}) - \mu_f)}+1 \right] + \log \left[ e^{-\beta (E(\vec{p}) + \mu_f)} + 1\right] \right\} ,
\end{split}
\label{eq:lsm:potential_divergent_logz0}
\end{equation}
with the dispersion relation $E(\vec{p}) = \sqrt{\smash[b]{p^2 + m_q^2}}$.
We work in the zero-temperature approximation $T=0$ and choose positive chemical potentials,
so the anti-particle contribution from the third term in $\{\ldots\}$ vanishes.
The integral of the second term in $\{\ldots\}$ was calculated in the zero-temperature pressure $P=-\Omega$ in equation \eqref{eq:nstars:pressure_zeroT}.
This time we also include and renormalize the infinite vacuum contribution from the integral of the first term in $\{\ldots\}$.
It is called the \emph{Dirac sea}, and we renormalize it in the modified minimal subtraction scheme in \cref{chap:diracsea},
arriving at expression \eqref{eq:diracsea:pole_expansion_modified}.
We also reinstate $x_f = p_f / m_q = \sqrt{\smash[b]{\mu_f^2-m_q^2}} / m_q$ into expression \eqref{eq:nstars:pressure_zeroT}.
Pulling all this together, the divergent grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:potential_divergent_logz0} becomes
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\Omega &= \pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0}) + N_c N_f \frac{m_q^4}{16 \pi^2} \Bigg[ \textcolor{red}{\frac{1}{\epsilon}} + \frac{3}{2} + \log\left(\frac{{\Lambda}^2}{m_q^2}\right) \Bigg] \\
	       &- \sum_{f=1}^{\smash{N_f}} \frac{N_c}{24 \pi^2} \left[ \left( 2 \mu_f^2 - 5 m_q^2 \right) \mu_f \sqrt{\mu_f^2 - m_q^2} + 3 m_q^4 \asinh \left( \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{\smash{f}}^2}{m_q^2}-1} \right) \right] .
\end{split}
\label{eq:lsm:grand_potential_nonrenormalized}
\end{equation}
The renormalization has introduced a renormalization scale $\Lambda$ that we will determine later.
It also exposes the Dirac sea vacuum divergence in the $\epsilon$-pole \textcolor{red}{$N_c N_f m_q^4 / 16 \pi^2 \epsilon$}.
Recalling that $m_q=g \avg{\sigma}$ and glancing back at the meson potential \eqref{eq:lsm:potential},
we also see that this divergence can be removed by the term \textcolor{blue}{$\lambda \avg{\sigma}^4 / 24$} in $\pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0})$
if the quartic coupling is shifted to
\begin{equation}
	\lambda \rightarrow \lambda + \textcolor{blue}{\delta\lambda}
	\qquad \text{with the counterterm} \qquad
	\textcolor{blue}{\delta\lambda = -N_c N_f \frac{3 g^4}{2 \pi^2 \epsilon}} .
\end{equation}
Then $\textcolor{red}{N_c N_f m_q^4 / 16 \pi^2 \epsilon} + \textcolor{blue}{\delta\lambda \avg{\sigma}^4 / 24} = 0$,
demonstrating that the theory is renormalizable.
Adding free electrons to the mix, the finite and renormalized grand potential is finally

As in the MIT bag model,
the particle densities \eqref{eq:master_intro:densities} are
\begin{equation}
	n_f = -\pdv{\Omega}{\mu_f} = \frac{N_c}{3 \pi^2} \Big( \mu_f^2 - m_q^2 \Big)^{\frac32}
	\qquad \text{and} \qquad

\label{eq:lsm:particle_densities}%
\end{equation}%
and the pressure \eqref{eq:master_intro:pressure} and energy density \eqref{eq:master_intro:energy_density} follow at $T=0$.

% equivalent remark is made in Folkestad/Andersen 2019 "Thermodynamics and phase diagram of Polykaov-loop extended chiral models"
% ("one-loop large-N_c limit")
On one side, it can be argued that treating bosons and fermions to zero and one loops is \emph{inconsistent}.
However, note that the fermionic contribution to the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} is of order $\bigo(N_c^1)$,
while any bosonic contribution with one loop would only be of order $\bigo(N_c^0)$.
On the other side, then, we can argue that our approach is \emph{consistent} in the \textbf{one-loop large-$N_c$ limit}.
The number of loops must be restricted to one, for with two loops, for example,
the $\bigo(N_c^1)$ Feynman diagram due to the $\bar{q} \sigma q$ Yukawa interaction should also be included.
Despite there only being $N_c=3$ colors in nature,
we briefly mentioned the success of the large-$N_c$ approximation in \cref{sec:master_intro:qcd}.
We will come back to this matter of consistency later.

\section{Parameter fit at tree-level}
\label{sec:lsm:parameter_fit}

To determine the four parameters $g$, $m^2$, $\lambda$ and $h$ in the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential},
we use measured values of $\avg{\sigma}$ and the curvature masses $ m_\sigma$, $m_\pi$ and $m_q$ in vacuum.
Inverting equations \eqref{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit} and \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_sigmapi},
we can express the parameters entirely in terms of these variables as
\begin{equation}
	g       = \frac{m_q}{\avg{\sigma}}, \quad % &\qquad& \text{(by \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_quark})} , \\
	m^2     = \frac{3m_\pi^2 - m_\sigma^2}{2}, \quad % &\qquad& \text{(by \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_sigma})} , \\
	\lambda = \frac{3 m_\sigma^2 - 3 m_\pi^2}{\avg{\sigma}^2} % &\qquad& \text{(by \eqref{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit})} .
	\quad \text{and} \quad
	h       = m_\pi^2 \avg{\sigma}. % &\qquad& \text{(by \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_pi})} , \\
\label{eq:lsm:parameters}
\end{equation}
According to \cite{ref:pdg_review_2021}, in vacuum the mean field is the pion decay constant $\avg{\sigma} = f_\pi = \SI{93}{\mega\electronvolt}$,
the average mass of the three pions is $m_\pi = \SI{138}{\mega\electronvolt}$
and the up and down quarks have almost equal masses $m_u \approx m_d \approx \SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
All these quantities have low uncertainty.


On the other hand, the mass $m_\sigma$ is very uncertain and hard to choose.
Even in 2002, according to the $\sigma$ meson status update \cite{ref:sigma_meson_status},
it was only known to lie in the huge uncertainty range $\SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt} \leq m_\sigma \leq \SI{1200}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
Today \cite{ref:pdg_review_2021} places it in the tighter range $\SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt} \leq m_\sigma \leq \SI{550}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
Ideally we would like to use a value within this range, but there are several problems.
First, the vacuum potential $\pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0})$ plotted in \cref{fig:lsm:potential_sigma_mass} does not have a minimum and is therefore useless for $m_\sigma \leq \SI{500}{\mega\electronvolt}$,
and the same happens with the three-flavor model in \cref{chap:lsm3f}.
We therefore operate with the three common values $m_\sigma = \{600,700,800\} \, \si{\mega\electronvolt}$ in both of the two models.
%The different values will illustrate qualitatively different behaviors of the chiral phase transition.
This is the best we can do and must be regarded as a shortcoming of the model.
Since the $\sigma$ particle was introduced in an ad-hoc manner
as a mere means to an end for the pions anyway,
we argue that it is the most legitimate candidate for discrimination.
%and that a discrepancy in this parameter is tolerable and that of least evil.

\Cref{tab:lsm2f:parameters} summarizes the chosen input values for $\avg{\sigma}=f_\pi$, $m_\pi$, $m_\sigma$ and $m_q=m_u=m_d$ in vacuum
and the corresponding output parameters $m^2$, $\lambda$, $g$ and $h$.

The renormalization procedure also introduced an undetermined renormalization scale $\Lambda$.
To determine it, we require that the minimum of the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} in vacuum, where $\vec{\mu}=0$,
remains at the minimum $\avg{\sigma} = f_\pi$ of the vacuum potential $\pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0})$.
Since $\pdv{\pot}/{\avg{\sigma}} = 0$ at $\avg{\sigma}=f_\pi$ already by assumption, we only need
\begin{equation}
	\pdv{\Omega}{\avg{\sigma}} =
	\pdv*{\Bigg[ N_c N_f \frac{m_q^4}{16 \pi^2} \bigg( \frac32 + \log \frac{\Lambda^2}{m_q^2} \bigg) \Bigg] }{\avg{\sigma}} = 0,
	\quad \text{yielding} \quad
	\Lambda = \frac{m_q}{\sqrt{e}} = \frac{g f_\pi}{\sqrt{e}} = \SI{182.0}{\mega\electronvolt}.

As mentioned at the end of \cref{sec:lsm:grand_potential},
our calculation of the grand potential can only be viewed as fully consistent in the one-loop large-$N_c$ limit,
so it is really inconsistent to fit parameters at tree-level using the curvature masses \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_sigmapi}.
The physical pole masses would really receive radiative loop corrections.
In \cref{sec:lsm2f:refinement} we will fit parameters consistently in the one-loop large-$N_c$ limit
and see that this resolves the large discrepancy in $m_\sigma$.

\section{Equation of state}

Before finding the general charge neutral equation of state,
it is easier and instructive to solve the special problem with imposed zero isospin $\mu_I=0$, or $\mu_u=\mu_d=\mu$.
This will give us some intuition for the shape of the grand potential in the charge-neutral case.
The chemical equilibrium constraint \eqref{eq:lsm:chemical_equilibrium} then says $\mu_e=0$,
so electrons are absent and only the two first lines in the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} contribute.
It is now a function $\Omega(\avg{\sigma},\mu)$ of only two variables that is easy to visualize, as done in \cref{fig:lsm:grand-potential-noisospin}.
Although we defined $\Omega$ as a function of $\avg{\sigma}$, we will discuss the following results in terms of $m_q = g \avg{\sigma}$ instead,
as it is easier to compare to the chemical potentials $\mu_f$.
We see that:
\begin{itemize}
\item For $\mu < \SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt} = m_q(f_\pi)$,
      the grand potential is independent of $\mu$,
      and we are in vacuum where only the first line of the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} contributes.
      By construction, the minimum lies at $\avg{\sigma} = f_\pi = \SI{93}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
      The feature that a \emph{range} of chemical potentials characterizes the vacuum is sometimes called the \emph{Silver Blaze property}.
      Chiral symmetry is spontaneously broken in vacuum, as demonstrated in \cref{sec:lsm:vacuum}.
\item For $\SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt} \leq \mu \lesssim \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}$,
      the quarks in the second line of the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} begin to contribute as we leave the vacuum during the chiral transition.
      For $m_\sigma <    \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$ the minimum jumps \emph{discontinuously}, corresponding to a \emph{first-order phase transition}.
      For $m_\sigma \geq \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$ its value changes fast and furiously but nevertheless \emph{continuously},
      and there is \emph{no phase transition}, only what is referred to as a rapid \emph{crossover}.
\item For $\mu \gtrsim \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}$,
      the minimum approaches the \emph{ultra-relativistic} or \emph{massless} limit $\avg{\sigma} \rightarrow 0$ asymptotically,
      but never quite reaches it,
      as chiral symmetry is gradually restored.
\end{itemize}

Our objective, however, is to determine the equation of state $\epsilon(P)$
when the chemical potentials are constrained by
the charge neutrality condition \eqref{eq:lsm:charge_neutrality}
in addition to the $\beta$-equilibrium condition \eqref{eq:lsm:chemical_equilibrium}.
This means that we must not solve only the self-consistency equation \eqref{eq:lsm:gap_equation},
but the \emph{system} of equations
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	0 &= \pdv{\Omega}{\avg{\sigma}} , \label{eq:lsm:minsys_min} \\
	%0 &= +\frac23 n_u - \frac13 n_d - n_e , \label{eq:lsm:minsys_charge} \\
	0 &= 2 \big(\mu_u^2-m_q^2\big)^\frac32 - \big(\mu_d^2-m_q^2\big)^\frac32 - \big(\mu_e^2-m_e^2\big)^\frac32 , \label{eq:lsm:minsys_charge} \\
	\mu_d &= \mu_u + \mu_e . \label{eq:lsm:minsys_chem}
\end{align}%
\label{eq:lsm:minsys}%
\end{subequations}%

This is a system of three equations for the four unknowns $\avg{\sigma}$, $\mu_u$, $\mu_d$ and $\mu_e$.
Do not forget that $m_q = g \avg{\sigma}$.
We parametrize solutions with one free variable, 
and calculate the pressure \eqref{eq:master_intro:pressure}, densities \eqref{eq:master_intro:densities}, energy density \eqref{eq:master_intro:energy_density}
and the equation of state $\epsilon(P)$ like in \cref{chap:mit}.

In particular, we now use $\avg{\sigma}$ as the free variable instead of $\mu$.
As revealed by peeking ahead at the results in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos-parametrization},
the possible presence of a phase transition implies that
one $\mu$ can correspond to multiple $\avg{\sigma}$,
while all $\avg{\sigma}$ correspond to only one $\mu$ (except in the vacuum).
It is therefore only the parametrization with $\avg{\sigma}$ that captures the multiple solutions.

How should we normalize the pressure this time?
With the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential},
the pressure $P = - \Omega$ will be nonzero in the vacuum because $\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0}) \neq 0$.
First, we therefore compute the pressure \emph{relative to} vacuum by shifting
\begin{equation}
	P \rightarrow P - P(\mu \leq \SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt}) = P + \pot(f_\pi,\vec{0}) .
\label{eq:lsm:pressure_bagless}
\end{equation}
Second, and like with the MIT bag model in \cref{chap:mit},
we allow for a bag constant $B$ by making the shift \eqref{eq:mit:bag_shift}.
After both shifts,
the pressure in the vacuum is $P(\mu \leq \SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt}) = -B$
and the non-quark contribution to the general pressure is
\begin{equation}
	-B(\avg{\sigma}) = -\big[B+\pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0})-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})\big]
\label{eq:lsm:bag_pressure}
\end{equation}
from the first line of the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential}.
Unlike the constant $B$ in the MIT bag model,
we can interpret $B(\avg{\sigma})$ as a dynamic bag pressure that ranges from $-B(f_\pi)=-B$ in the vacuum to $-B(0) = -\big[B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})\big]$ in the ultra-relativistic limit.
We will come back to allowed values of the bag constant after we have found the equation of state with $B=0$.

\pagebreak
The numerical implementation in \cref{sec:num:qstars2f}
gives the equation of state in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos}:
\begin{itemize}
\item The phase transition or crossover behaves similarly to how it did in \cref{fig:lsm:grand-potential-noisospin}:
      the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} and its minimum $\avg{\sigma}=m_q/g$ is independent of $\mu=(\mu_u+\mu_d)/2$ in vacuum where $\mu < \SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt}$;
      undergoes a crossover (with $m_\sigma \geq \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$) or a first-order phase transition (with $m_\sigma < \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$) for $\SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt} < \mu \lesssim \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}$;
      and approaches the ultra-relativistic limit $\avg{\sigma}\rightarrow 0$ for $\mu \gtrsim \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
\item The isospin chemical potential $\mu_I=(\mu_u-\mu_d)/2$ increases with no bound as $\mu_u$ and $\mu_d$ grow apart,
      and its magnitude exceeds the half pion mass $m_\pi/2 = \SI{69}{\mega\electronvolt}$ for $\mu \geq \SI{575}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
      \emph{This means that our assumption of neglecting pion condensation is inconsistent!}
      A more detailed study should therefore take it into account, but this is outside our scope.
\item With $m_\sigma < \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$ and the resulting phase transition,
      the parametrized $P$-$\epsilon$-curve corresponds to an \emph{ambiguous equation of state}
      where a low pressure corresponds to \emph{multiple} energy densities.
      In this case we use the Maxwell construction to produce a well-defined invertible equation of state,
      as described in \cite[equation (4.69)]{ref:master_francesco}.
      With $m_\sigma \geq \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$ and the crossover we do not need to think about this.
\item The ultra-relativistic solution obtained in \cref{sec:mit:eos} is restored as $\avg{\sigma} \rightarrow 0$.
      In particular, the slopes $\odv{\epsilon}/{P} = 3$ of the equations of state there and here agree,
      while their different relative offsets are accounted for by the bag shift \eqref{eq:mit:bag_shift}.
\item The equation of state always satisfies the causality condition \eqref{eq:nstars:stability_speed_of_sound}
      and the microscopic stability criterion \eqref{eq:nstars:stability_pressure_energy_density}.
\item Although the electrons have an appreciable chemical potential $\mu_e$,
      their density $n_e$ is several orders of magnitude below the quark densities $n_u$ and $n_d$ and is hardly noticeable,
      like in \cref{chap:mit}.
      Their main job is to ensure that the charge neutrality condition \eqref{eq:lsm:minsys_charge} is met.
      Coupled with the $\beta$-equilibrium condition \eqref{eq:lsm:minsys_chem},
      it is what causes the isospin imbalance as $\mu_u$ and $\mu_d$ grow apart.
\end{itemize}

Moreover, the program in \cref{sec:num:qstars2f} solves the two-flavor inequality \eqref{eq:mit:bag_stability} numerically
and reports the lower bag bounds
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	B \geq (\SI{110.6}{\mega\electronvolt})^4           \quad \Big(\text{or } B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0}) \geq (\SI{145.4}{\mega\electronvolt})^4\Big) \qquad \Big(m_\sigma = \SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big), \label{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound_600} \\
	B \geq \phantom{0}(\SI{67.7}{\mega\electronvolt})^4 \quad \Big(\text{or } B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0}) \geq (\SI{146.3}{\mega\electronvolt})^4\Big) \qquad \Big(m_\sigma = \SI{700}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big), \label{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound_700} \\
	B \geq \phantom{0}(\SI{27.0}{\mega\electronvolt})^4 \quad \Big(\text{or } B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0}) \geq (\SI{156.5}{\mega\electronvolt})^4\Big) \qquad \Big(m_\sigma = \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big). \label{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound_800}
\end{align}%%
\label{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound}%
\end{subequations}%%
In the next chapter we study the three-flavor generalization of this model
and find the complementing upper bounds \eqref{eq:lsm3f:bag_upper_bound}
due to the strange matter hypothesis.
Note that these upper bounds almost coincide with the lower bounds,
so the inequalities can practically speaking be squeezed into equalities \emph{if} the strange matter hypothesis is true.
On the other hand, 
the lower bounds are based on instability of two-flavor quark matter and are certain.
We focus on the bag constants that lie \emph{at} the lower bounds \eqref{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound},
as we saw in \cref{chap:mit} that they generate stiffer equations of state and hence greater maximum masses,
and greater bag constants would be forbidden anyway \emph{if} the strange matter hypothesis holds.
The main takeaway is that $B$ can violate the upper bounds \eqref{eq:lsm3f:bag_upper_bound},
but certainly not the lower bounds \eqref{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound}.

Also note that it is the bounds of $B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})$, not $B$,
that are comparable to the MIT bag model bound \eqref{eq:mit:bag_window}.
This is because we have seen that the quark-meson model
approaches the MIT bag model only in the ultra-relativistic limit $\avg{\sigma} \rightarrow 0$.
Hence the same goes for the dynamic bag pressure \eqref{eq:lsm:bag_pressure},
which evaluates to $-B(0)=-[B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})]$ in this limit.

\section{Quark star solutions}
\label{sec:lsm:stars}

Having found the minimum allowed bag constants,
we now modify the equation of state
with the shift \eqref{eq:mit:bag_shift}
using bag constants at and above the lower bounds \eqref{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound}
and solve the corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations \eqref{eq:master_intro:tov}.
From the numerical implementation in \cref{sec:num:qstars2f},
we find the mass-radius relations in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-mass-radius}:
\begin{itemize}
\item For bag constants that just satisfy the lower bounds \eqref{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound} for $\SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt} \leq m_\sigma \leq \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$,
      stars have maximum masses $1.7 \, M_\odot \leq M \leq 2.0 \, M_\odot$ and corresponding radii $R \approx \SI{11}{\kilo\meter}$.
      The heaviest star has an average mass density of $\rho = M / (4 \pi R^3/3) = \SI{7e14}{\kilo\gram\per\liter}$!
\item For greater bag constants,
      the strange matter hypothesis and corresponding upper bounds \eqref{eq:lsm3f:bag_upper_bound}
      are violated.
      We pay special attention to the lowest bag constants that respect both the lower and upper bounds,
      as the stellar masses and radii decrease with increasing bag constants anyway.
\item As $m_\sigma$ increases,
      the maximum mass decreases and becomes more resilient to changes in $B$, and stars tend to inflate up to larger sizes for low pressures.
\item The results are generally comparable to the MIT bag model solutions in \cref{fig:mit:mass_radius}.
\end{itemize}

Let us also examine the radial profiles of interesting quantities in a star.
The solution of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation \eqref{eq:master_intro:tov} yields $P(r)$ and $m(r)$ directly,
and $\epsilon(r)$ is then easily computed from the equation of state $\epsilon(P)$.
Meanwhile, $\mu(r)$ can be obtained from $P(r)$ after inverting $P(\mu)$ to $\mu(P)$,
and $n_i(r)$ and other properties can then be looked up in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos}.
In \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-star} we take an in-depth look at the maximum mass star without a phase transition:
\begin{itemize}
\label{list:lsm:2-flavor-star-discussion}
\item By definition, the pressure $P(R)=0$ vanishes at the surface $R=\SI{11.3}{\kilo\meter}$,
      and the corresponding cumulative mass $m(R)=M=\SI{1.77}{}\,M_\odot$ evaluates to the total mass.
\item The quark chemical potential $\mu(R)$ at the surface exceeds the vacuum value $\SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt}$ because of the bag shift \eqref{eq:mit:bag_shift}.
      Fortunately, the central value $\mu(0) = \SI{490}{\mega\electronvolt}$ does not exceed $\SI{575}{\mega\electronvolt}$,
      beyond which neglecting pion condensation was inconsistent. % in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos-parametrization}.
\item The kink around $\mu \approx \SI{320}{\mega\electronvolt}$ corresponds to the chiral crossover and takes place very close to the surface of the star,
      and the star has a thin crust in which the particle densities rapidly drops to near-vanishing values and the cumulative mass flattens out.
%\item Hybrid neutron stars are typically assumed to consist of nuclear matter for $n_B \lesssim 2 n_\text{sat}$,
      %quark matter for $4 n_\text{sat} \lesssim n_B \lesssim 7 n_\text{sat}$ and something in-between for $2 n_\text{sat} \lesssim n_B \lesssim 4 n_\text{sat}$.
      %If the core of this quark star were to model the core of such a hybrid star,
      %it would have a radius $R' \approx \SI{5}{\kilo\meter}$, mass $M'=m(R')=\SI{0.45}{\kilo\meter}$ and central pressure $P_c \approx \SI{0.33}{\giga\electronvolt\per\femto\meter\cubed}$
      %and consist predominantly of quarks with twice as many up quarks as down quarks.
\end{itemize}

\TODO{just drop this part?
Having described we \emph{do} and \emph{should do}, let us also remark on what we \emph{did} and \emph{shouldn't do}.
A tempting and similar approach to minimizing $\Omega$ with respect to $\avg{\sigma}$ is to rather construct the potential $\Omega'(\avg{\sigma}, \mu_u) = \Omega(\avg{\sigma}, \mu_u, \mu_d(\mu_u,\avg{\sigma}), \mu_e(\mu_u,\avg{\sigma}))$, then minimize $\Omega'$ with respect to $\avg{\sigma}$.
In this approach, we could create two functions $\mu_{d/e}(\avg{\sigma},\mu_u)$ that calculate the two remaining chemical potentials by solving the charge neutrality condition \eqref{eq:lsm:minsys_charge} with a simple scalar root finder, both of which would be invoked upon evaluating the new potential $\Omega'(\avg{\sigma},\mu_u)$.
This sounds really nice, because we could then use a simple minimization algorithm on $\Omega'$, sparing us from calculating $\pdv{\Omega}/{\avg{\sigma}}$ and ensuring that we always find \emph{minima}, instead of maxima that we can obtain when solving $\pdv{\Omega}/{\avg{\sigma}}=0$.
In effect, we would completely circumvent the need of ever solving a \emph{system} of equations!
Even better, the two-dimensional potential $\Omega'$ would be possible to visualize as in \cref{fig:lsm:grand-potential-nonneutral}, allowing us to verify our solution visually.
Unfortunately, $\pdv{\Omega'}/{\avg{\sigma}} \neq \pdv{\Omega}/{\avg{\sigma}}$, because the two differs by terms arising from the chain rule, so this approach is different and -- like many nice-sounding things -- \emph{wrong}!
The cause of this source of confusion is that \emph{the charge neutrality condition \eqref{eq:lsm:minsys_charge} depends on the same variable that the potential should be minimized with respect to.}
Hopefully, this remark will save someone from enduring this painful realization again.

\section{Consistent parameter fit in the one-loop large-\texorpdfstring{$N_c$}{Nc} limit}
\label{sec:lsm2f:refinement}

As explained at the end of \cref{sec:lsm:parameter_fit},
fitting parameters at tree-level is inconsistent
because our calculation of the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential}
can only be considered consistent in the one-loop large-$N_c$ limit.
In a fully consistent treatment, the parameters should be fit at the same level to which the grand potential is calculated.
The inconsistent method is, however, the conventional approach taken in the literature.
\cite{ref:lsm2f_nuclear,ref:lsm_2f,ref:lsm3f,ref:lsm3f_compact_stars}.

To conclude this chapter we examine the effects of using such a consistent approach.
In the chiral limit $h=0$,
\cite{ref:jo_lsm_consistent_chiral} has consistently matched the parameters in the one-loop large-$N_c$ limit
by relating the physical masses to the pion decay constant and running couplings with the minimal subtraction renormalization scheme.
Their work is generalized to the physical point $h \neq 0$ that we consider here in \cite{ref:jo_lsm_consistent_physical},
where their generalized inhomogeneous chiral condensate $q$ can simply be set to $q=0$ to recover our homogeneous condensate.
They find the grand potential
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\Omega &= \frac12 \frac{m_R^2(\lambda)}{g_R^2(\lambda)} \Delta^2 + \frac{\lambda_R(\lambda)}{24 g_R(\lambda)^4} \Delta^4 - \frac{h_R(\lambda)}{g_R(\lambda)} \Delta + \frac{N_c N_f}{16 \pi^2} \Delta^4 \bigg[ \frac32 + \log \frac{\Lambda^2}{\Delta^2} \bigg] + \Omega_q + \Omega_e,
\end{split}
\label{eq:lsm2f:grand_potential_consistent_before}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_q+\Omega_e$ is the same contribution from quarks and electrons as in the two last lines of our grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential}.
Here all the couplings $m_R^2(\Lambda)$, $\lambda_R(\Lambda)$, $g_R(\Lambda)$ and $h_R(\Lambda)$ run with the renormalization scale $\Lambda$.
After solving their renormalization group equations and inserting their solutions into the above expression,
they find the following explicit grand potential in equation (7):
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\Omega &= \frac{3 m_\pi^2 f_\pi^2}{4} \Bigg\{ 1 - \frac{4 m_q^2 N_c}{(4\pi)^2 f_\pi^2} m_\pi^2 F'(m_\pi^2) \Bigg\} \frac{\Delta^2}{m_q^2} \\
	       &- \frac{m_\sigma^2 f_\pi^2}{4} \Bigg\{ 1 + \frac{4 m_q^2 N_c}{(4\pi)^2 f_\pi^2} \Bigg[ \bigg(1 - \frac{4 m_q^2}{m_\sigma^2}\bigg) F(m_\sigma^2) + \frac{4 m_q^2}{m_\sigma^2} - F(m_\pi^2) - m_\pi^2 F'(m_\pi^2) \Bigg] \Bigg\} \frac{\Delta^2}{m_q^2} \\
	       &+ \frac{m_\sigma^2 f_\pi^2}{8} \Bigg\{ 1 - \frac{4 m_q^2 N_c}{(4 \pi)^2 f_\pi^2} \Bigg[ \frac{4 m_q^2}{m_\sigma^2} \log \frac{\Delta^2}{m_q^2} - \bigg(1 - \frac{4 m_q^2}{m_\sigma^2}\bigg) F(m_\sigma^2) + F(m_\pi^2) + m_\pi^2 F'(m_\pi^2) \Bigg] \Bigg\} \frac{\Delta^4}{m_q^4} \\
	       &- \frac{m_\pi^2 f_\pi^2}{8} \Bigg\{ 1 - \frac{4 m_q^2 N_c}{(4\pi)^2 f_\pi^2} m_\pi^2 F'(m_\pi^2) \Bigg\} \frac{\Delta^4}{m_q^4} - m_\pi^2 f_\pi^2 \Bigg\{ 1 - \frac{4 m_q^2 N_c}{(4\pi)^2 f_\pi^2} m_\pi^2 F'(m_\pi^2) \Bigg\} \frac{\Delta}{m_q} + \frac{3 N_c}{(4 \pi)^2} \Delta^4 \\
	       &+ \Omega_q + \Omega_e ,
\end{split}
\label{eq:lsm2f:grand_potential_consistent}
\end{equation}
where they have defined
\begin{equation}
	F(p^2) = 2 - 2 r \atan \Big(\frac1r\Big), \qquad
	F'(p^2) = \frac{4 m_q^2}{p^4 r} \atan \Big(\frac1r\Big) - \frac{1}{p^2}, \qquad
	r = \sqrt{\frac{4 m_q^2}{p^2}-1} .
\end{equation}
Note that in contrast to our dynamic masses \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_sigmapi},
their $m_q$, $m_\pi$ and $m_\sigma$ refer exclusively to \emph{vacuum masses},
and the dynamic quark mass is denoted $\Delta$, equivalent to our $m_q=g\avg{\sigma}$.
In our opinion, it is easiest to simply adopt their convention temporarily in this section,
as any attempt to reconcile it with our convention
would only clutter the already cluttered expression \eqref{eq:lsm2f:grand_potential_consistent}.
Also note that the renormalization scale $\Lambda$ has coincidentally disappeared from the original expression \eqref{eq:lsm2f:grand_potential_consistent_before} upon substitution of the renormalized couplings!

Like before, we will fix $m_q$, $m_\pi$ and $f_\pi$ to the vacuum values in \cref{tab:lsm2f:parameters}, but vary $m_\sigma$.
Whereas \cref{fig:lsm:potential_sigma_mass} shows that our original inconsistently fit grand potential only had stable minima for $m_\sigma \geq \SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt}$ in vacuum,
\cref{fig:lsm:potential_sigma_mass_ref} shows that it appears for $m_\sigma \geq \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}$ with the consistently fit grand potential.
This allows us to set $m_\sigma$ to values within its measured range $\SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt} \leq m_\sigma \leq \SI{550}{\mega\electronvolt}$ without breaking the model!

Repeating our earlier calculations with the new grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm2f:grand_potential_consistent} for lower values of $m_\sigma$,
we find the equation of state in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos-ref},
the lower bag constant bounds
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	B \geq (\SI{107.3}{\mega\electronvolt})^4           \quad \Big(\text{or } B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0}) \geq (\SI{145.4}{\mega\electronvolt})^4\Big) \qquad \Big(m_\sigma = \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big), \\
	B \geq \phantom{0}(\SI{83.9}{\mega\electronvolt})^4 \quad \Big(\text{or } B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0}) \geq (\SI{145.9}{\mega\electronvolt})^4\Big) \qquad \Big(m_\sigma = \SI{500}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big), \\

\end{align}%
\label{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound_ref}%
\end{subequations}
and the mass-radius solutions in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-mass-radius-ref}.

The ``consistent'' results with $m_\sigma=\{400,500,600\} \, \si{\mega\electronvolt}$ are
virtually identical to the ``inconsistent'' results with $m_\sigma=\{600,700,800\} \, \si{\mega\electronvolt}$.
This can be seen by comparing the individual features in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos-ref,fig:lsm:2-flavor-mass-radius-ref}
to those in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos,fig:lsm:2-flavor-mass-radius},
or more easily by noting that the vacuum potentials in \cref{fig:lsm:potential_sigma_mass_ref},
\emph{which is the only difference between the two approaches},
more or less coincide with those in \cref{fig:lsm:potential_sigma_mass} that have about $\SI{200}{\mega\electronvolt}$ larger values of $m_\sigma$.

This approach shows the importance of fitting the parameters of the model consistently
in order to achieve correspondence between experimental and model parameters.
In our original inconsistent approach we had no other choice but to use too large values of $m_\sigma$ to avoid breaking the model and generate any results at all,
leaving us with a doubtful and unsatisfactory feeling.
However, comparison with the consistent approach restores our trust in these results
and tells us that we should not be too worried about 
fitting values of $m_\sigma$ at tree-level that are about $\SI{200}{\mega\electronvolt}$ too large.

\section{Summary}

In this chapter we have modeled pure quark stars consisting of deconfined up and down quarks with the two-flavor quark-meson model.
Our main results were the equation of state in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos}, mass-radius solutions in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-mass-radius} and the radial profile of a representative maximum mass star in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-star}.
For $\SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt} \leq m_\sigma \leq \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$ and the corresponding lowest bag constants that respect the lower bounds \eqref{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound} and hence instability of two-flavor quark matter,
we obtained quark stars with maximum masses $1.7 \, M_\odot \leq M \leq 2.0 \, M_\odot$ and corresponding radii $R \approx \SI{11}{\kilo\meter}$.

Chiral symmetry was restored in a crossover for $m_\sigma \geq \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$
and in a discontinuous phase transition for $m_\sigma < \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
Our heart rates increased momentarily when we saw that neglecting pion condensation was an inconsistent approximation for $\mu \geq \SI{575}{\mega\electronvolt}$,
but stabilized when we saw that the chemical potential in the inspected maximum mass star did not exceed this.
We found it difficult to fit measured values $\SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt} \leq m_\sigma \leq \SI{550}{\mega\electronvolt}$ for the $\sigma$ meson without breaking the model and had to make do with larger values,
but later regained trust in our results when we explained this with the inconsistency of fitting parameters at tree-level to a grand potential that is calculated to one fermion loop.

Due to the previously discussed instability of two-flavor quark matter with respect to hadronic matter,
pure two-flavor quark stars are unlikely to be realized in nature.
Nevertheless, their analysis is a natural stepping stone for discussing possibly stable strange quark stars and hybrid stars with quark matter in the core.

%Acceptable bag constants $B$ were determined by assuming that two-flavor quark matter is unstable compared to hadronic matter at zero pressure.
%Unfortunately, this also tells us that our model is inconsistent: the pure quark star consists of two-flavor quark matter all the way out to the surface \emph{where the pressure vanishes by definition}.
%This means that it is more likely to find the core of our quark star as part of a hybrid star, inside which there is a transition from quark matter to hadronic matter away from the center, consistent with the stability criterion.

% \TODO{note to self: two inconsistencies: (1) match couplings at tree level although using one-loop potential. (2) neglecting bosonic one-loop contribution to effective potential (this is consistent in $N_c\rightarrow \infty$ limit, but inconsistent in terms of number of loops)}
