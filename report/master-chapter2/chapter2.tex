\TODO{two inconsistencies: (1) match couplings at tree level although using one-loop potential. (2) neglecting bosonic one-loop contribution to effective potential (this is consistent in $N_c\rightarrow \infty$ limit, but inconsistent in terms of number of loops)}

At low energy, the effective degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics are not individual quarks,
but nucleons composed of up and down quarks and the three pions that we saw arose from the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking pattern \eqref{eq:qcd:symmetry_breaking_pattern}.
The MIT bag model that we discussed in \cref{chap:mit} modeled quark stars by simply confining a free Fermi gas of quarks in baryons with a bag constant $B$.
We will now crank up the difficulty and investigate the \textbf{linear sigma model}, which also takes chiral symmetry breaking and the resulting pions into account by introducing an ``ad--hoc'' $\sigma$ particle.
The linear sigma model was originally introduced by \cite{ref:lsm_original} as an effective model for nucleons interacting with pions and scalar mesons.
We will interpret the fermions as quarks instead of nucleons in what is then commonly referred to as a \textbf{quark-meson model}.

The physical justification for this effective model of quantum chromodynamics is best made retrospectively after seeing exactly how it gives rise to chiral symmetry breaking.
We will therefore take the model as granted from the start and justify it as we go along.

\section{Lagrangian and symmetries}

The Lagrangian density for the linear sigma model coupled to quarks is \cite{ref:jo_lsm_consistent_physical}
\begin{equation}
	\lagr = \bar{q} \Big[ i \slashed\partial + \mu \gamma^0 - g \big( \sigma + i \gamma^5 \vec\tau \cdot \vec\pi \big) \Big] q
	      + \frac12 \Big[ \big( \partial_\mu \sigma \big)^2 + \big( \partial_\mu \vec\pi \big)^2 \Big] - \pot(\sigma,\vec\pi)
\label{eq:lsm:lagrangian}
\end{equation}
with the meson potential
\begin{equation}
	\pot(\sigma, \vec\pi) = \frac{m^2}{2} \big( \sigma^2 + \vec\pi^2 \big) + \frac{\lambda}{4!} \big( \sigma^2 + \vec\pi^2 \big)^2 - h \sigma .
\label{eq:lsm:potential}
\end{equation}
The quark fields behave as in the MIT bag model Lagrangian \eqref{eq:mit:lagrangian} with $N_f=2$ flavor indices $u$ and $d$, $N_c=3$ color indices and four Dirac spinor indices, and are coupled to two chemical potentials $\mu = \diag (\mu_u, \mu_d)$.
However, they are now seemingly massless and coupled to the bosonic $\sigma$ meson and three pions $\vec\pi = [\pi^+, \pi^-, \pi^0]^T$ with a Yukawa coupling $g$ and the Dirac matrices \eqref{eq:tft:pauli_matrices}.
The meson potential features three couplings: $m^2<0$, $\lambda>0$ and $h>0$ \TODO{verify signs from numerical results!}.

Like the quantum chromodynamics Lagrangian \eqref{eq:qcd:lagrangian}, the quark-meson model Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian} has the vector $U(1)_V$ and axial $U(1)_A$ symmetry shown in \cref{sec:qcd:symmetry}.
In contrast to the mass-conditional chiral symmetry of the former Lagrangian, however, the latter is \emph{unconditionally} invariant under chiral symmetry $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ when $h=0$ and $\mu = 0$.
To see this, first rewrite the Yukawa coupling term in terms of left-handed and right-handed chiral fields:
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
	\bar{q} \big[\sigma + i \gamma^5 \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{\pi}\big] q &= \bar{q} \big[ (P_+ + P_-) \sigma + (P_+ - P_-) i \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{\pi}\big] q && \; \big( P_\pm = \tfrac{1}{2} (1 \pm \gamma^5) \big) \\
	                                                           %&= \bar{q} \big[ P_+ (\sigma + i \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{\pi}) + P_- (\sigma - i \vec{\tau} \cdot \vec{\pi}) \big] q && \; \big( \text{distributivity} \big)\\
	                                                           &= \bar{q} \big[ P_+ \phi + P_- \phi^\dagger\big] q && \; \big( \text{define } \phi=\sigma+i\vec{\tau}\cdot\vec{\pi} \big) \\
	                                                           &= \bar{q} \big[ P_+^2 \phi + P_-^2 \phi^\dagger\big] q && \; \big( \text{$P_\pm=P_\pm^2$ lives in spinor-space} \big) \\
	                                                           &= \bar{q} \big[ P_+ \phi P_+ + P_- \phi^\dagger P_-\big] q && \; \big( \text{$\phi$ lives in flavor-space} \big)\\
	                                                           &= \bar{q}_- \phi q_+ + \bar{q}_+ \phi^\dagger q_- && \; \big( \text{$P_\pm q = q_\pm$, $\bar{q} P_\pm = (P_\mp q)^\dagger \gamma^0 = \bar{q}_\mp$} \big).\\
\end{aligned}
\label{eq:lsm:yukawa_symmetry}
\end{equation}
Second, observe that the meson potential \eqref{eq:lsm:potential} with $h=0$ only depends on the flavor-space trace
\begin{equation}
	\tfrac12 \trace\big[\phi^\dagger \phi\big] = \tfrac12 \big( \underbrace{\trace\big[1\big]}_2 \sigma^2 - i^2 \underbrace{\trace\big[\tau_a \tau_b \big]}_{2 \delta_{ab}} \pi_a \pi_b \big) = \sigma^2 + \vec{\pi}^2.
\label{eq:lsm:meson_symmetry}
\end{equation}
Under the $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ transformation 
\begin{equation}
	q_+ \rightarrow U_+ q_+, \qquad
	q_- \rightarrow U_- q_-
	\qquad \text{and} \qquad
	\phi   \rightarrow U_- \phi U_+^\dagger
\end{equation}
the Yukawa interaction \eqref{eq:lsm:yukawa_symmetry},
the meson potential argument \eqref{eq:lsm:meson_symmetry}
and hence the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian} are invariant.
This proves the claimed unconditional $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ symmetry when $h=0$ and $\mu=0$.
Since the group $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ is isomorphic to $O(4)$,
the symmetry can equivalently be understood by considering the meson fields as a four-vector $[\sigma, \vec{\pi}]^T$
and noting that the meson potential \eqref{eq:lsm:potential} is invariant under rotation of this vector in $O(4)$.

What can be the relevance of this unconditional symmetry,
when it was precisely the \emph{breaking} of chiral symmetry that led to the pions of quantum chromodynamics in \cref{sec:qcd:symmetry}?
In vacuum the fermions do not contribute to the grand potential,
and the ground state values $\sigma = \avg{\sigma}$ and $\vec{\pi} = \avg{\vec{\pi}}$ are given by minima of the meson potential $\pot(\avg{\sigma},\avg{\vec{\pi}})$ illustrated in \cref{fig:lsm:potential}.
From equation \eqref{eq:lsm:potential} we see that they are given by
\begin{equation}
	%\vec{\pi} = \avg{\vec{\pi}}
	%\quad \text{and} \quad
	%\sigma = \avg{\sigma}
	%\pdv{\pot}{\sigma}_{(\sigma,\vec\pi)=(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0})} = m^2 \avg{\sigma} + \frac{\lambda}{6} \avg{\sigma}^3 - h = 0.
	\pdv{\pot}{\pi_a} = \avg{\pi_a} \Big[ m^2 + \frac{\lambda}{6} \big(\avg{\sigma}^2 + \avg{\vec{\pi}}^2\big) \Big] = 0
	\quad \text{and} \quad
	\pdv{\pot}{\sigma} = \avg{\sigma} \Big[ m^2 + \frac{\lambda}{6} \big(\avg{\sigma}^2 + \avg{\vec{\pi}}^2\big) \Big] - h = 0.
\label{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit}
\end{equation}
The qualitative nature of the solutions depend on whether $h$ vanishes.
\begin{itemize}
\item In the \textbf{chiral limit} $h=0$,
      the ground state solutions are a degenerate range of stable minima along the circle $\avg{\sigma}^2+\avg{\vec{\pi}}^2=-6m^2/\lambda$.
      Without any loss of generality, let us pick the one located at $\avg{\sigma} = \sqrt{-6m^2/\lambda}$ and $\avg{\vec{\pi}}=0$.
\item At the \textbf{physical point} $h \neq 0$,
      the ground state is discrete and located at $\avg{\sigma} \neq 0$ and $\avg{\vec{\pi}}=0$ determined implicitly by \eqref{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit}.
\end{itemize}
Note that $\avg{\vec{\pi}} = 0$ in both cases.
To account for quantum fluctuations $\tilde{\sigma}$ and $\tilde{\vec{\pi}}$ around the ground states, let us write
\begin{equation}
	\sigma = \avg{\sigma} + \tilde{\sigma}
	\qquad \text{and} \qquad
	\vec\pi = \avg{\vec\pi} + \tilde{\vec{\pi}}.
\end{equation}
Up to second order in the quantum fluctuations,
the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian} becomes
\begin{equation}
	\lagr = \sum_{f=\{u,d\}} \sum_{c=1}^{N_c} \bar{q}_{f,c} \Big[ i \slashed\partial + \mu \gamma^0 - m_q \Big] q_{f,c}
	      + \frac12 \left[ \left( \partial_\mu \tilde{\sigma} \right)^2 + \left( \partial_\mu \tilde{\vec\pi} \right)^2 \right] - \pot(\sigma,\vec\pi) , %\pot(\avg{\sigma}+\tilde{\sigma},\avg{\vec\pi}+\tilde{\vec\pi}) ,
\end{equation}
and the meson potential \eqref{eq:lsm:potential} becomes
\begin{equation}
	\pot(\sigma,\vec\pi) = \pot(\avg{\sigma},\avg{\vec\pi}) + h \tilde{\sigma} + \frac12 m_\sigma^2 \tilde{\sigma}^2 + \frac12 m_\pi^2 \tilde{\pi}^2.
\end{equation}
The quark and meson fields have now acquired the effective masses
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	m_q &= g \avg{\sigma}, \label{eq:lsm:mass_quark} \\
	m_\sigma^2 &= \pdv[2]{\pot}{\sigma}\iffalse_{\substack{\sigma=\avg{\sigma}\\\vec{\pi}=\avg{\vec{\pi}}}}\fi    = m^2 + \frac{\lambda}{2} \avg{\sigma}^2 \equalexplabove{\smash{\text{by \eqref{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit}}}} \frac{3h}{\avg{\sigma}} - 2 m^2 , \label{eq:lsm:mass_sigma} \\
	m_\pi^2    &= \pdv[2]{\pot}{\vec{\pi}}\iffalse_{\substack{\sigma=\avg{\sigma}\\\vec{\pi}=\avg{\vec{\pi}}}}\fi = m^2 + \frac{\lambda}{6} \avg{\sigma}^2 \equalexplbelow{\text{by \eqref{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit}}} \frac{h}{\avg{\sigma}} . \label{eq:lsm:mass_pi}
\end{align}%
\label{eq:lsm:mass_sigmapi}%
\end{subequations}%
The qualitative nature of the pions depends on whether $h$ vanishes.
\begin{itemize}
\item In the \textbf{chiral limit} $h = 0$ the $SU(2) \times SU(2)$ symmetry \eqref{eq:lsm:meson_symmetry} is exact,
      and we saw above that there is a degenerate range of ground states.
      Upon committing to the minimum above, the $O(4)$ rotation symmetry of the original four meson fields $[\sigma,\vec\pi]^T$ are spontaneously broken
      to rotation of only the three pion quantum fluctuations $\tilde{\vec\pi}$ in $O(3)$.
      Accordingly, the pion mass \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_pi} vanishes and so that the three pions are indeed Goldstone bosons associated with spontaneous symmetry breaking.
\item At the \textbf{physical point} $h \neq 0$, the $SU(2) \times SU(2)$ symmetry \eqref{eq:lsm:meson_symmetry} is explicitly broken,
      and we saw above that there is a unique ground state.
      Accordingly, the pion gains a small mass \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_pi}.
\end{itemize}
\label{elaborate on mexican hat analogy, brim, tip/tilt, etc.}
In neither case does the $\sigma$ mass \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_sigma} vanish -- there is no reason for it do so.

The gist of the linear sigma model and its physical justification is this (take a breath):
although the linear sigma model symmetry breaking pattern
\begin{equation}
	SU(2) \times SU(2) \simeq O(4) \qquad \longrightarrow \qquad O(3)
\end{equation}
is \emph{different} from the quantum chromodynamics symmetry breaking pattern \eqref{eq:qcd:symmetry_breaking_pattern} ``under the hood'',
it gives rise to the \emph{same} degrees of freedom (pions) ``on the outside'' and is therefore indistinguishable from it.
This was achieved by the specific Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian} with a $\sigma$ particle in addition to the three pions.
The parameter $h \neq 0$ only serves to explicitly break this into an approximate symmetry,
just like the quark masses break the chiral symmetry of quantum chromodynamics.
According to Weinberg's philosophy presented in \cref{sec:qcd:phase_diagram_and_methods},
the quark-meson model is therefore an appropriate effective model of quantum chromodynamics at low energy.

\section{Grand potential and equation of state}

\TODO{write $\Omega(\avg{\sigma},\vec{\mu})$ in order to keep function declaration general for ``any'' chemical potential combination?}

We now set out to calculate the grand potential \eqref{eq:master_intro:grand_potential}.
With the fermionic quark fields $q$ and bosonic meson fields $\sigma$ and $\vec\pi$
and the coupling of chemical potentials $\mu$ to conserved currents already baked into the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian},
the partition function \eqref{eq:master_intro:partition_function} becomes
\begin{equation}
	Z = \oint_- \pathintdif \bar{q} \oint_- \pathintdif q \oint_+ \pathintdif \sigma \oint_+ \pathintdif \vec\pi \exp \left\{ \int_0^\beta \dif \tau \int_V \dif^3 x \, \lagr_E[\bar{q}, q, \sigma, \vec\pi]  \right\} .
\end{equation}
To calculate it we will use the \emph{mean-field approximation} for the bosonic fields,
replacing them by their yet unknown expectation values $\avg{\sigma}$ and $\avg{\vec\pi}$ in the classical ground state
(all we know is that $\avg{\sigma}=f_\pi$ and $\avg{\vec{\pi}}=\vec{0}$ in \emph{vacuum})
and simply ignoring their quantum fluctuations $\tilde{\sigma}$ and $\tilde{\vec\pi}$.
In contrast we will give the fermionic fields a full treatment,
motivated by their more dramatic behavior at zero temperature.
\TODO{is this argument valid, with BEC etc?}
After calculating the grand potential,
the precise values of the mean fields are found \emph{self-consistently with the original assumption} as minima of the grand potential according to
\begin{equation}
	\pdv{\Omega}{\avg{\sigma}} = \pdv{\Omega}{\avg{\vec\pi}} = 0.
\label{eq:lsm:gap_equation}
\end{equation}
We call this the \textbf{self-consistency equation} for the mean fields.
The mean-field approximation is commonly used in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory of superconductivity to determine an energy gap,
and the name \textbf{gap equation} is frequently used there and even as a relic in other applications like ours.

In our treatment we will also neglect pion condensation and \emph{assume} that $\avg{\vec\pi}=0$ \emph{always} vanishes
and only $\avg{\sigma}$ needs to be determined.
This is known to be true at $T=0$ when the isospin chemical potential \eqref{eq:master_intro:chemical_potentials_transformed} does not exceed half the pion mass
-- see for example the study of pion condensation in the quark-meson model by \cite{ref:jo_lsm_consistent,ref:jo_lsm_pion_condensation}.
After inserting the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian} the partition function reads
\begin{equation}
	Z = \prod_{f=1}^{\smash{N_f}} \prod_{c=1}^{\smash{N_c}} \oint_- \!\! \pathintdif \bar{q}_{f,c} \oint_- \!\! \pathintdif q_{f,c} \exp \Bigg\{ \int_0^{\beta} \dif \tau \int_V \dif^3 x \Bigg[ \sum_{f=1}^{\smash{N_f}} \sum_{c=1}^{N_c} \bar{q}_{f,c} \big( i \slashed\partial - m_q + \mu_f \gamma^0 \big) q_{f,c} - \pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0}) \Bigg] \Bigg\}.
\end{equation}
The meson potential is independent of the fields and can be pulled out of the integrals,
while the fermionic contribution decouples into a product of identical integrals.
We therefore have
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	%\log Z &= -\frac12 \beta V m^2 \avg{\sigma}^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4!} \beta V \avg{\sigma}^4 + \beta V h \avg{\sigma} \\
	       %&+ \sum_{f=1}^{N_f} \sum_{c=1}^{N_c} \log \oint_- \pathintdif \bar{q}_f^c \oint_- \pathintdif q_f^c \exp \left\{ \int_0^\beta \dif \tau \int_V \dif^3 x \, \bar{q}_f^c (i \slashed\partial + \mu_f \gamma^0 - m_q) q_f^c \right\} .
	\log Z = -\pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0}) + \sum_{f=1}^{N_f} \sum_{c=1}^{N_c} \log \oint_- \!\! \pathintdif \bar{q}_{f,c} \oint_- \!\! \pathintdif q_{f,c} \exp \bigg\{ \! \int_0^\beta \! \dif \tau \int_V \! \dif^3 x \, \bar{q}_{f,c} \big(i \slashed\partial + \mu_f \gamma^0 - m_q\big) q_{f,c} \! \bigg\} .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We have already calculated the path integral in the last term
from equation \eqref{eq:tft:dirac_partition_function_first} to equation \eqref{eq:tft:dirac_partition_function}.
Here we get an additional factor $\sum_{c=1}^{N_c} = N_c$ from the color sum because the summand is independent of $c$,
while the flavor sum $\sum_{f=1}^{\smash{N_f}}$ yields $N_f$ terms that differ only by the unique chemical potentials $\mu_f$ associated with each quark flavor. 
Thus, the grand potential \eqref{eq:master_intro:grand_potential} is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	%\log Z &= -\frac12 \beta V m^2 \avg{\sigma}^2 - \frac{\lambda}{4!} \beta V \avg{\sigma}^4 + \beta V h \avg{\sigma} \\
	       %&+ 2 V N_c \sum_{f=1}^{N_f} \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{(2 \pi)^3} \left\{ \beta E(\vec{p}) + \log \left[ e^{-\beta (E(\vec{p}) - \mu_f)}+1 \right] + \log \left[ e^{-\beta (E(\vec{p}) + \mu_f)} + 1\right] \right\} ,
	\Omega = \pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0}) - \frac{2 N_c}{\beta} \sum_{f=1}^{N_f} \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{(2 \pi)^3} \left\{ \beta E(\vec{p}) + \log \left[ e^{-\beta (E(\vec{p}) - \mu_f)}+1 \right] + \log \left[ e^{-\beta (E(\vec{p}) + \mu_f)} + 1\right] \right\} ,
\end{split}
\label{eq:lsm:potential_divergent_logz0}
\end{equation}
with the dispersion relation $E(\vec{p}) = \sqrt{\smash[b]{p^2 + m_q^2}}$.

% equivalent remark is made in Folkestad/Andersen 2019 "Thermodynamics and phase diagram of Polykaov-loop extended chiral models"
Note that the fermionic contribution to the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:potential_divergent_logz0} is of order $\bigo(N_c)$,
while any bosonic contribution is only of order $\bigo(1)$.
This means that our approach of excluding bosonic fluctuations that sounds very \emph{inconsistent} in one regard
would be \emph{exact} in the limit $N_c \rightarrow \infty$
and can therefore be viewed as \emph{consistent} in the so-called large-$N_c$ approximation.
Although only $N_c = 3$ in nature and it may sound like we are not making a great case for ourselves,
this is in fact a common and well-studied approximation scheme of quantum chromodynamics
and the most common treatment found in the literature. \TODO{true? references?}

Like before we work in the zero-temperature approximation $T=0$ and choose positive chemical potentials so the anti-particle contribution from the last term in curly brackets vanishes.
The middle term in curly brackets was calculated in the zero-temperature pressure $P=-\Omega$ in \eqref{eq:nstars:pressure_zeroT}.
This time we will also include and renormalize the infinite vacuum contribution from the first term in curly brackets.
Reinstating the Fermi momenta $p_f = \sqrt{\smash[b]{\mu_f^2-m_q^2}}$, we obtain
\begin{equation}
	\Omega = -N_c N_f \Omega_0 - \smashoperator{\sum_{\vphantom{\big|} f=\{u,d\}}} \frac{N_c}{24 \pi^2} \left[ \left( 2 \mu_f^2 - 5 m_q^2 \right) \mu_f \sqrt{\mu_f^2 - m_q^2} + 3 m_q^4 \asinh \left( \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{\smash{f}}^2}{m_q^2}-1} \right) \right]
\end{equation}
with the vacuum contribution
\begin{equation}
	\Omega_0 = -2 \int \frac{\dif^3 p}{(2 \pi)^3} \sqrt{p^2 + m_q^2}.
\label{eq:lsm:vacuum_contribution_3dim}
\end{equation}
To renormalize it we use dimensional regularization in the minimal subtraction scheme.
In $d = 3 - 2 \epsilon$ spatial dimensions, the vacuum contribution is
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\Omega_0 &= -2 \Lambda^{3-d} \int \frac{\dif^d p}{(2 \pi)^d} \sqrt{p^2 + m_q^2} \\
	         &= -2 \Lambda^{3-d} \frac{2 \pi^{d/2}}{\Gamma(d/2)} \int_0^\infty \frac{\dif p \, p^{d-1}}{(2 \pi)^d} \sqrt{p^2 + m_q^2} .
\end{split}
\label{eq:lsm:vacuum_contribution_ddim}
\end{equation}
%\TODO{what happens to the dimensions of the potential $V$ (as consequence of requiring $\log Z$ to be dimensionless)? $V \rightarrow V \lambda^{-2\epsilon}$?}
We have also multiplied the integral by $\Lambda^{3-d} = \Lambda^{2\epsilon}$ where $\Lambda$ is some number with $\unit{\Lambda} = \unit{p}$,
so that $\unit{\lambda^{3-d} \dif^d p} = \unit{\dif^3 p}$ and $\Omega$ is well-defined with correct \emph{dimension} in all \emph{dimensions}.
There is nothing that forbids us from doing so,
as the regulator still accomplishes its only job of reducing the new integral \eqref{eq:lsm:vacuum_contribution_ddim} to the old integral \eqref{eq:lsm:vacuum_contribution_3dim} when we send $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$.
The momentum integral can be written as an analytical continuation of the \emph{Beta function} \cite{ref:beta_function}
\begin{equation}
	B(x,y) = \int_0^\infty \dif t \, \frac{t^{x-1}}{(1+t)^{x+y}} = \frac{\Gamma(x) \Gamma(y)}{\Gamma(x+y)}
\end{equation}
if we substitute $t = p^2/m_q^2$ with $\dif t = 2 p \dif p / m_q^2$.
We then find
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\Omega_0 &= -\Lambda^{3-d} m_q^{d+1} \frac{2 (4 \pi)^{-d/2}}{\Gamma\big(\frac{d}{2}\big)} \int_0^\infty \dif t \, \frac{t^{d/2-1}}{(1+t)^{-1/2}} \\
	         &= -\Lambda^{3-d} m_q^{d+1} \frac{2 (4 \pi)^{-d/2}}{\Gamma\big(\frac{d}{2}\big)} \frac{\Gamma\big(\frac{d}{2}\big) \Gamma\big( \textstyle{-\frac{d+1}{2}} \big)}{\Gamma\big( \textstyle{-\frac{1}{2}} \big)} .
\end{split}
\end{equation}
We now cancel the two factors $\Gamma(d/2)$ and replace $\Gamma(-1/2) = -2\sqrt{\pi}$.
Then we insert $d = 3 - 2 \epsilon$ back and use the property $\Gamma(z) = \Gamma(z+1) / z$ twice to transport the argument of the Gamma function infinitesimally close to its pole at $0$,
where we use its asymptotic expansion $\Gamma(\epsilon) = 1/\epsilon + \gamma + \bigo(\epsilon)$ upon arrival.
Expanding everything to zeroth order in $\epsilon$ then yields
\begin{equation}
	\Omega_0 =       \frac{m_q^4}{8 \pi^2} \left( 4 \pi \frac{\Lambda^2}{m_q^2} \right)^\epsilon \Gamma(-2 + \epsilon)
	         \taylor \frac{m_q^4}{16 \pi^2} \left( \frac{1}{\epsilon} + \log \frac{\Lambda^2}{m_q^2} + \frac32 - \gamma + \log 4 \pi \right) .
\label{eq:lsm:vacuum_contribution_final}
\end{equation}
In hindsight, we now see that we could get rid of the terms $-\gamma + \log 4 \pi$ if we had rather used the modified minimal subtraction scheme, where one rescales $\Lambda^2 \rightarrow \Lambda^2 e^\gamma / 4 \pi$.
With the vacuum contribution \eqref{eq:lsm:vacuum_contribution_final} in this renormalization scheme, the full logarithm \eqref{eq:lsm:potential_divergent_logz0} becomes
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\Omega &= \pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0}) + N_c N_f \frac{m_q^4}{16 \pi^2} \left[ \frac{1}{\epsilon} + \frac{3}{2} + \log\left(\frac{{\Lambda}^2}{m_q^2}\right) \right] \\
	       &- \smashoperator{\sum_{\vphantom{\big|} f=\{u,d\}}} \frac{N_c}{24 \pi^2} \left[ \left( 2 \mu_f^2 - 5 m_q^2 \right) \mu_f \sqrt{\mu_f^2 - m_q^2} + 3 m_q^4 \asinh \left( \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{\smash{f}}^2}{m_q^2}-1} \right) \right]
\end{split}
\end{equation}
This investigation has revealed that the term $N_c N_f m_q^4 / 16 \pi^2 \epsilon$ is responsible for the vacuum divergence.
Recalling that $m_q=g \avg{\sigma}$,
we also see that the divergence can be removed by the term $\lambda \avg{\sigma}^4 / 24$ in the meson potential $\pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0})$
if we shift the quartic coupling
\begin{equation}
	\lambda \rightarrow \lambda + \delta\lambda
	\qquad \text{with the counterterm} \qquad
	\delta\lambda = -N_c N_f \frac{3 g^4}{2 \pi^2 \epsilon} .
\end{equation}
Adding free electrons to the mix, the finite and renormalized grand potential is finally
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\Omega(\avg{\sigma},\mu_u,\mu_d,\mu_e) &= \pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0}) + N_c N_f \frac{m_q^4}{16 \pi^2} \left[ \frac{3}{2} + \log\left(\frac{{\Lambda}^2}{m_q^2}\right) \right] \\
	                                       %&- \frac{N_c}{24 \pi^2} \sum_{f=\{u,d\}} \left[ \left( 2 \mu_f^2 - 5 m_q^2 \right) \mu_f \sqrt{\mu_f^2 - m_q^2} + 3 m_q^4 \asinh \left( \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{\smash{f}}^2}{m_q^2}-1} \right) \right] \\
	                                       %&- \frac{  1}{24 \pi^2} \left[ \left( 2 \mu_e^2 - 5 m_e^2 \right) \mu_e \sqrt{\mu_e^2 - m_e^2} + 3 m_e^4 \asinh \left( \sqrt{\frac{\mu_e^2}{m_e^2}-1} \right) \right] .
	                                       &-\smashoperator{\sum_{\vphantom{\big|} f=\{u,d\}}} \frac{N_c}{24 \pi^2} \left[ \left( 2 \mu_f^2 - 5 m_q^2 \right) \mu_f \sqrt{\mu_f^2 - m_q^2} + 3 m_q^4 \asinh \left( \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{\smash{f}}^2}{m_q^2}-1} \right) \right] \\
	                                       &-\phantom{\sum} \, \frac{1}{24 \pi^2} \left[ \left( 2 \mu_e^2 - 5 m_e^2 \right) \mu_e \sqrt{\mu_e^2 - m_e^2} \, \, + \, 3 m_e^4 \asinh \left( \sqrt{\frac{\mu_{\smash{e}}^2}{m_e^2}-1} \right) \right].
\end{split}
\label{eq:lsm:grand_potential}
\end{equation}

The particle densities are the same as in the MIT bag model:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	n_u &= -\pdv{\Omega}{\mu_u} = \frac{N_c}{3 \pi^2} \Big( \mu_u^2 - m_q^2 \Big)^{\frac32}, \\
	n_d &= -\pdv{\Omega}{\mu_d} = \frac{N_c}{3 \pi^2} \Big( \mu_d^2 - m_q^2 \Big)^{\frac32}, \\
	n_e &= -\pdv{\Omega}{\mu_e} = \frac{  1}{3 \pi^2} \Big( \mu_e^2 - m_e^2 \Big)^{\frac32}.
\end{align}%
\label{eq:lsm:particle_densities}%
\end{subequations}%
The pressure \eqref{eq:master_intro:pressure} and energy density \eqref{eq:master_intro:energy_density} follow straightforwardly from the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} and particle densities \eqref{eq:lsm:particle_densities}.

\subsection{Parameter fitting}
\label{sec:lsm:parameter_fit}

To determine the four paremeters $g$, $m^2$, $\lambda$ and $h$ in the Lagrangian \eqref{eq:lsm:lagrangian},
we use measured values of the mean field $\avg{\sigma}$ and masses $m_\sigma$, $m_\pi$ and $m_q$ in vacuum.
Inverting equations \eqref{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit}, \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_sigmapi} and \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_quark}, we then find the parameters
\begin{equation}
	g       = \frac{m_q}{f_\pi}, \quad % &\qquad& \text{(by \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_quark})} , \\
	h       = m_\pi^2 f_\pi, \quad % &\qquad& \text{(by \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_pi})} , \\
	m^2     = \frac{3m_\pi^2 - m_\sigma^2}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad % &\qquad& \text{(by \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_sigma})} , \\
	\lambda = \frac{3 m_\sigma^2 - 3 m_\pi^2}{f_\pi^2} .    % &\qquad& \text{(by \eqref{eq:lsm:ground_state_implicit})} .
\label{eq:lsm:parameters}
\end{equation}
According to \cite{ref:pdg_review_2021}, in vacuum the mean field $\avg{\sigma} = f_\pi = \SI{93}{\mega\electronvolt}$ is the pion decay constant,
$m_\pi = \SI{138}{\mega\electronvolt}$ is the average mass of the three pions
and the up and down quarks have almost equal masses $m_u \approx m_d \approx \SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
All of these quantities have low uncertainty.

\caption{\label{fig:lsm:potential_sigma_mass}
Two-flavor grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} in vacuum with $\vec{\mu}=\vec{0}$ for different $m_\sigma$.}
\end{figure}

On the other hand, the mass $m_\sigma$ is very uncertain and hard to choose.
Even in 2002, according to the $\sigma$ meson status update \cite{ref:sigma_meson_status},
it was only known to lie in the huge uncertainty range $\SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt} < m_\sigma < \SI{1200}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
Today \cite{ref:pdg_review_2021} places it in the tighter range $\SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt} < m_\sigma < \SI{550}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
Ideally we would like to use a value within this range, but there are several problems.
First, the vacuum potential $\pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0})$ plotted in \cref{fig:lsm:potential_sigma_mass} does not have a minimum and is therefore useless for $m_\sigma \lesssim \SI{500}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
In \cref{chap:lsm3f} we will see that the same happens in the three-flavor case, only then for even greater masses $m_\sigma \lesssim \SI{700}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
Since we would like to compare the results obtained with two and three flavors,
we decide to mainly operate with two common values $m_\sigma = \{700,800\} \, \si{\mega\electronvolt}$ through most of our analysis,
but will also present results for $m_\sigma = \SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt}$ in this chapter.
The two different values will illustrate qualitatively different behaviors of the chiral phase transition.
This is the best we can do and must be regarded as a shortcoming of our model.

The $\sigma$ meson is controversial and was introduced in an unsatisfying and ad-hoc manner anyway,
in a sense only to make way for the pions that are known low-energy effective degrees of freedom of quantum chromodynamics.
Perhaps cynically, we therefore argue that if \emph{someone} must be treated badly for the model to even function,
the $\sigma$ meson brings with it the least severe physical consequences and is the most deserving candidate.

Note that the renormalization procedure also introduced an unknown parameter $\Lambda$.
To determine it, we require that the minimum of the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential}
remains at the minimum $\avg{\sigma} = f_\pi$ of the vacuum potential $\pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0})$.
Since $\pdv{\pot}/{\avg{\sigma}} = 0$ at $\avg{\sigma}=f_\pi$ already by assumption, we only need
\begin{equation}
	\pdv{\Omega}{\avg{\sigma}}_{\avg{\sigma}=f_\pi} =
	\pdv*{\Bigg[ N_c N_f \frac{m_q^4}{16 \pi^2} \bigg( \frac32 + \log \frac{\Lambda^2}{m_q^2} \bigg) \Bigg] }{\avg{\sigma}} = 0,
	\qquad \text{yielding} \qquad
	\Lambda = \frac{g f_\pi}{\sqrt{e}}.

\Cref{tab:lsm2f:parameters} summarizes the chosen input values for $\avg{\sigma}=f_\pi$, $m_\pi$, $m_\sigma$ and $m_q$ and the corresponding output parameters $m^2$, $\lambda$, $g$, $h$ and $\Lambda$.

Also note that we have treated bosons and fit the parameters of the model using the \emph{tree level} masses \eqref{eq:lsm:mass_sigmapi},
but handled fermions to one loop. 
This is also inconsistent, as the tree-level masses would really receive radiative loop corrections.
We will later investigate the effects of fitting the parameters consistently at one loop level.

Before finding the general charge neutral equation of state,
it is easier and instructive to solve the special problem with imposed zero isospin $\mu_I=0$, or $\mu_u=\mu_d=\mu$.
This will give us some intuition for the shape of the grand potential in the general case.
Then the chemical equilibrium constraint \eqref{eq:lsm:chemical_equilibrium} says $\mu_e=0$,
so electrons are absent and only the two first lines in the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} contribute.
The grand potential $\Omega(\avg{\sigma},\mu)$ is now a function of two variables that is easy to visualize, as done in \cref{fig:lsm:grand-potential-noisospin}.
We see that:
\begin{itemize}
\item For $\mu < \SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt} = m_q(f_\pi)$ the grand potential is independent of $\mu$,
      and we are in vacuum where only the first line of the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} contributes.
      By construction, the minimum lies at $\avg{\sigma} = f_\pi = \SI{93}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
      The feature that a \emph{range} of chemical potentials characterizes the vacuum is sometimes called the \emph{Silver Blaze property}.
\item For $\SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt} < \mu \lesssim \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}$,
      the quarks in the second line of the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} begins to contribute as we leave the vacuum state.
      For $m_\sigma = \SI{700}{\mega\electronvolt}$ the minimum jumps \emph{discontinuously}, corresponding to a \emph{first-order phase transition}.
      On the other hand, for $m_\sigma = \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$ it moves quickly but still \emph{continuously}, and there is \emph{no phase transition}
      -- this behavior is often referred to as a \emph{crossover}.
\item For $\mu \gtrsim \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}$ the minimum approaches the ultra-relativistic limit $m_q \rightarrow 0$ asymptotically, but never quite reaches it.
\end{itemize}

Our objective, however, is to determine the equation of state $\epsilon(P)$ in the general case,
where the chemical potentials are constrained by the conditions of charge neutrality \eqref{eq:lsm:charge_neutrality} and $\beta$-equilibrium \eqref{eq:lsm:chemical_equilibrium} into account.
This means that we must not solve only the self-consistency equation \eqref{eq:lsm:gap_equation},
but the \emph{system} of two equations
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	0 &= \pdv{\Omega}{m_q} , \label{eq:lsm:minsys_min} \\
	%0 &= +\frac23 n_u - \frac13 n_d - n_e , \label{eq:lsm:minsys_charge} \\
	0 &= 2 \Big[\mu_u^2-m_q^2\Big]^\frac32 - \Big[(\mu_u+\mu_e)^2-m_q^2\Big]^\frac32 - \Big[\mu_e^2-m_e^2\Big]^\frac32 \label{eq:lsm:minsys_charge}.
\end{align}%
\label{eq:lsm:minsys}%
\end{subequations}%
for a given value of one variable -- say $m_q=g \avg{\sigma}$ -- which we now use instead of $\avg{\sigma}$.
The solution yields $\mu_u$ and $\mu_e$, and the remaining chemical potential $\mu_d$ can then be calculated from the equilibrium constraint \eqref{eq:lsm:chemical_equilibrium}.
Parametrizing multiple solutions in this manner, it is straightforward to calculate the densities \eqref{eq:lsm:particle_densities}, pressure \eqref{eq:master_intro:pressure} and energy density \eqref{eq:master_intro:energy_density},
and hence the equation of state $\epsilon(P)$.

How should we normalize the pressure this time?
With the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential},
the pressure $P = - \Omega$ will be nonzero in the vacuum state with $\mu < \SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
First, we therefore compute the pressure \emph{relative to} vacuum by shifting
\begin{equation}
	P \rightarrow P - P(\mu < \SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt}) = P + \Omega(\avg{\sigma}=f_\pi) .
\label{eq:lsm:pressure_bagless}
\end{equation}
Second, and like with the MIT bag model in \cref{chap:mit},
we allow for a bag constant $B$ by making the shift \eqref{eq:mit:bag_shift}.
After both shifts, the pressure $P$ contains a contribution
\begin{equation}
	-B(\avg{\sigma}) = -\big[B+\pot(\avg{\sigma},\vec{0})-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})\big]
\label{eq:lsm:bag_pressure}
\end{equation}
from the first line of the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} in addition to the contribution from the particles.
We can interpret $B(\avg{\sigma})$ as an effective density-dependent bag pressure that ranges from $-B(f_\pi)=-B$ in vacuum to $-B(0) = -\big[B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})\big]$ in the ultra-relativistic limit
unlike the constant $B$ in the MIT bag model.
Solving inequality \eqref{eq:mit:bag_stability} numerically, we obtain the lower bag bounds
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	B^\frac14 > \SI{110.6}{\mega\electronvolt}           \quad \Big(\text{or } \big(B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})\big)^\frac14 > \SI{145.4}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big) \qquad \Big(m_\sigma = \SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big), \\
	B^\frac14 > \phantom{0}\SI{67.7}{\mega\electronvolt} \quad \Big(\text{or } \big(B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})\big)^\frac14 > \SI{146.3}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big) \qquad \Big(m_\sigma = \SI{700}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big), \\
	B^\frac14 > \phantom{0}\SI{27.0}{\mega\electronvolt} \quad \Big(\text{or } \big(B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})\big)^\frac14 > \SI{156.5}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big) \qquad \Big(m_\sigma = \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big).
\end{align}%%
\label{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound}%
\end{subequations}%%
In the next chapter we study the three-flavor model and complement the lower bound for $m_\sigma=\SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$ by the upper bound \eqref{eq:lsm3f:bag_upper_bound_800},
yielding the closed bag window
\begin{equation}
	\SI{27.0}{\mega\electronvolt} < B^\frac14 < \SI{46.5}{\mega\electronvolt}.
\label{eq:lsm:bag_window_800}
\end{equation}
With $m_\sigma=\SI{700}{\mega\electronvolt}$, however, the three-flavor inequality \eqref{eq:mit:bag_stability} has no solution and we only have the lower bound above.

As pointed out by \cite[section IV-B]{ref:quark_star_review}, it is generally not meaningful to compare bag constants across different models.
Anyway, note that because of the vacuum normalization \eqref{eq:lsm:pressure_bagless} it is the bounds of $B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})$ -- not $B$ -- that is comparable to the MIT bag constant lower bound \eqref{eq:mit:bag_window}.

The details of the numerical implementation can be found in \cref{sec:num:qstars2f} \TODO{write it}.
We find the equation of state shown in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos}.
A discussion of the results is in order:
\begin{itemize}
\item The phase transition or crossover behaves qualitatively identically as in \cref{fig:lsm:grand-potential-noisospin}:
      the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} and its minimum $\avg{\sigma}$ is independent of $\mu$ in vacuum where $\mu < \SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt}$;
      undergoes a crossover (with $m_\sigma=\SI{700}{\mega\electronvolt}$) and a first-order phase transition (with $m_\sigma=\SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$) for $\SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt} < \mu \lesssim \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}$;
      and approaches the ultra-relativistic limit $\avg{\sigma}\rightarrow 0$ for $\mu \gtrsim \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
\item The isospin chemical potential $\mu_I=(\mu_u-\mu_d)/2$ increases with no bound as $\mu_u$ and $\mu_d$ grow apart,
      and its magnitude exceeds the half pion mass $m_\pi/2 = \SI{69}{\mega\electronvolt}$ at $\mu_Q = \SI{575}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
      \emph{This means that our assumption that we could neglect isospin is inconsistent!}
      Our analysis should ideally have been repeated with isospin taken into account, but this is outside our scope.\
\item With $m_\sigma=\SI{700}{\mega\electronvolt}$ and the resulting phase transition,
      the parametrized $P$-$\epsilon$-curve does corresponds to an \emph{ambiguous equation of state}.
      For very low pressures, one pressure corresponds to multiple energy densities.
      In this case we use the Maxwell construction described in \TODO{write and ref appendix} to produce an invertible and hence usable equation of state.
      With $m_\sigma=\SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$ we do not need to think about this.
      \TODO{check if I actually need Maxwell construction, since bag constant may move problematic region outside EOS anyway.}
      \TODO{Maxwell construction is almost the same as saying that largest $P$ for given $\mu$ always wins (i.e. lowest and most stable $\Omega$)}
\item The ultra-relativistic solution obtained in \cref{sec:mit:eos} is restored in the ultra-relativistic limit $\avg{\sigma} \rightarrow 0$.
      In particular, the slopes of the equations of state agree $\odv{\epsilon}/{P} = 3$,
      while their different normalization is accounted for by the bag shift \eqref{eq:mit:bag_shift} and different bag bounds \eqref{eq:mit:bag_window} and \eqref{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound} in vacuum.
      \TODO{least confusing to normalize to common scale or keep it like this?}
\item The equation of state always satisfies the microscopic stability criteria \eqref{eq:nstars:stability_speed_of_sound} and \eqref{eq:nstars:stability_pressure_energy_density}.
\item Although the electrons have an appreciable chemical potential $\mu_e$, the electron \emph{density} $n_e$ is hardly noticeable compared to the quark densities $n_u$ and $n_d$.
      Just like in \cref{chap:mit} the density is nonzero, only several orders of magnitude below the quark densities.
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

With the equation of state, we now solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations \eqref{eq:master_intro:tov} with multiple bag pressures above the lower bounds \eqref{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound}.
We find the central pressure-parametrized mass-radius curves in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-mass-radius}, and see that:
\begin{itemize}
\item The most massive star has $M = 2.0 \, M_\odot$ and $R = \SI{11}{\kilo\meter}$.
      It occurs for the lowest value of $m_\sigma=\SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt}$ and saturates the lower bag constant bound \eqref{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound}, but there is no upper bound in this case.
      Its average mass density is $\rho = M / (4 \pi R^3/3) = \SI{7e17}{\kilo\gram\per\meter\cubed} = \SI{7e14}{\kilo\gram\per\liter}$!
\item For $m_\sigma = \SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$ we have the closed bag window \eqref{eq:lsm:bag_window_800},
      and the maximum mass stars have $M \approx \SI{1.76}{} M_\odot$ and $\SI{10}{\kilo\meter} < R < \SI{12}{\kilo\meter}$.
\item As $m_\sigma$ increases away from its measured value,
      the maximum mass decreases and becomes more resilient to changes in $B$ and stars tend to inflate up to larger sizes for low pressures.
\item In general the masses and radii are comparable to the MIT bag model solutions in \cref{fig:mit:mass_radius}.
\end{itemize}

In \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-star} we take an in-depth look at the most ``extreme'' stable star measured in terms of the quark chemical potential $\mu_Q$
that is in the bag window and does not complicate things with a phase transition.
This is the maximum mass star along the sequence that saturates the upper bag constant bound \eqref{eq:lsm3f:bag_upper_bound} with $m_\sigma=\SI{800}{\mega\electronvolt}$.
We see that:
\begin{itemize}
\item By definition, the pressure $P(R)=0$ vanishes at the radius $R=\SI{10.4}{\kilo\meter}$,
      and the corresponding cumulative mass $m(R)=M=\SI{1.76}{}\,M_\odot$ evaluates to the total mass.
\item The quark chemical potential $\mu_Q(R)$ at the surface exceeds the vacuum value $\SI{300}{\mega\electronvolt}$ because of the bag constant shift \eqref{eq:mit:bag_shift}.
\item Fortunately, the quark chemical potential $\mu_Q(r)$ never exceeds $\SI{575}{\mega\electronvolt}$, beyond which we saw that neglecting pion condensation was an inconsistent approximation in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos-parametrization}.
\item The crossover around $\mu_Q \approx \SI{320}{\mega\electronvolt}$ takes place very close to the surface of the star,
      and the star has a thin crust in which the particle densities rapidly drops to near-vanishing values and the cumulative mass flattens out.
\item Hybrid neutron stars are typically assumed to consist of nuclear matter for $n_B \lesssim 2 n_\text{sat}$,
      quark matter for $4 n_\text{sat} \lesssim n_B \lesssim 7 n_\text{sat}$ and something in-between for $2 n_\text{sat} \lesssim n_B \lesssim 4 n_\text{sat}$.
      If the core of this quark star were to model the core of such a hybrid star,
      it would have a radius $R' \approx \SI{5}{\kilo\meter}$, mass $M'=m(R')=\SI{0.45}{\kilo\meter}$, central pressure $P_c \approx \SI{0.33}{\giga\electronvolt\per\femto\meter\cubed}$
      and consist predominantly of quarks with twice as many up quarks as down quarks.

\TODO{just drop this part?
Having described we \emph{do} and \emph{should do}, let us also remark on what we \emph{did} and \emph{shouldn't do}.
A tempting and similar approach to minimizing $\Omega$ with respect to $\avg{\sigma}$ is to rather construct the potential $\Omega'(\avg{\sigma}, \mu_u) = \Omega(\avg{\sigma}, \mu_u, \mu_d(\mu_u,\avg{\sigma}), \mu_e(\mu_u,\avg{\sigma}))$, then minimize $\Omega'$ with respect to $\avg{\sigma}$.
In this approach, we could create two functions $\mu_{d/e}(\avg{\sigma},\mu_u)$ that calculate the two remaining chemical potentials by solving the charge neutrality condition \eqref{eq:lsm:minsys_charge} with a simple scalar root finder, both of which would be invoked upon evaluating the new potential $\Omega'(\avg{\sigma},\mu_u)$.
This sounds really nice, because we could then use a simple minimization algorithm on $\Omega'$, sparing us from calculating $\pdv{\Omega}/{\avg{\sigma}}$ and ensuring that we always find \emph{minima}, instead of maxima that we can obtain when solving $\pdv{\Omega}/{\avg{\sigma}}=0$.
In effect, we would completely circumvent the need of ever solving a \emph{system} of equations!
Even better, the two-dimensional potential $\Omega'$ would be possible to visualize as in \cref{fig:lsm:grand-potential-nonneutral}, allowing us to verify our solution visually.
Unfortunately, $\pdv{\Omega'}/{\avg{\sigma}} \neq \pdv{\Omega}/{\avg{\sigma}}$, because the two differs by terms arising from the chain rule, so this approach is different and -- like many nice-sounding things -- \emph{wrong}!
The cause of this source of confusion is that \emph{the charge neutrality condition \eqref{eq:lsm:minsys_charge} depends on the same variable that the potential should be minimized with respect to.}
Hopefully, this remark will save someone from enduring this painful realization again.

\section{Refinements with consistent parameter fitting}

As we remarked at the end of \cref{sec:lsm:parameter_fit},
fitting parameters from tree-level relations is inconsistent because we calculated the grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential} to one-loop in the quarks.
This is, however, the conventional approach often taken in the literature -- see for example \cite{ref:jo_lsm_consistent_chiral,ref:lsm_2f,ref:lsm2f_nuclear}.
In a consistent treatment, the parameters should be fitted at the same level to which the grand potential is calculated.

To conclude this chapter we examine the effects of using such a consistent approach.
In the chiral limit $h=0$, \cite{ref:jo_lsm_consistent_chiral} has consistently matched the parameters at one-loop level by relating the physical masses to the pion decay constant and running masses and couplings at one-loop level.
The work is done in the minimal renormalization scheme and large-$N_c$ limit, and is generalized to the physical point $h \neq 0$ that we consider here in \cite{ref:jo_lsm_consistent_physical}.
Their analysis also contains an inhomogeneous chiral condensate $q$, but we can simply set $q=0$ in their results to recover to a homogeneous condensate.
In appendix C of the latter reference, they find the grand potential
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\Omega &= \frac12 \frac{m_R^2}{g_R^2} \Delta^2 + \frac{\lambda_R}{24 g_R^4} \Delta^4 - \frac{h_R}{g_R} \Delta + \frac{N_c N_f}{16 \pi^2} \Delta^4 \bigg[ \frac32 + \log \frac{\Lambda^2}{\Delta^2} \bigg] + \Omega_q + \Omega_e,
\end{split}
\label{eq:lsm2f:grand_potential_consistent_before}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_q+\Omega_e$ is the same contribution from quarks and electrons as in the two last lines of our grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm:grand_potential}.
Now all the masses and coupling $m_R^2(\Lambda)$, $\lambda_R(\Lambda)$, $g_R(\Lambda)$ and $h_R(\Lambda)$ run with the renormalization scale $\Lambda$.
After solving their renormalization group equations and inserting their solutions into the above expression, they find the following explicit grand potential in equation (7):
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\Omega &= \frac{3 m_\pi^2 f_\pi^2}{4} \Bigg\{ 1 - \frac{4 m_q^2 N_c}{(4\pi)^2 f_\pi^2} m_\pi^2 F'(m_\pi^2) \Bigg\} \frac{\Delta^2}{m_q^2} \\
	       &- \frac{m_\sigma^2 f_\pi^2}{4} \Bigg\{ 1 + \frac{4 m_q^2 N_c}{(4\pi)^2 f_\pi^2} \Bigg[ \bigg(1 - \frac{4 m_q^2}{m_\sigma^2}\bigg) F(m_\sigma^2) + \frac{4 m_q^2}{m_\sigma^2} - F(m_\pi^2) - m_\pi^2 F'(m_\pi^2) \Bigg] \Bigg\} \frac{\Delta^2}{m_q^2} \\
	       &+ \frac{m_\sigma^2 f_\pi^2}{8} \Bigg\{ 1 - \frac{4 m_q^2 N_c}{(4 \pi)^2 f_\pi^2} \Bigg[ \frac{4 m_q^2}{m_\sigma^2} \log \frac{\Delta^2}{m_q^2} - \bigg(1 - \frac{4 m_q^2}{m_\sigma^2}\bigg) F(m_\sigma^2) + F(m_\pi^2) + m_\pi^2 F'(m_\pi^2) \Bigg] \Bigg\} \frac{\Delta^4}{m_q^4} \\
	       &- \frac{m_\pi^2 f_\pi^2}{8} \Bigg\{ 1 - \frac{4 m_q^2 N_c}{(4\pi)^2 f_\pi^2} m_\pi^2 F'(m_\pi^2) \Bigg\} \frac{\Delta^4}{m_q^4} - m_\pi^2 f_\pi^2 \Bigg\{ 1 - \frac{4 m_q^2 N_c}{(4\pi)^2 f_\pi^2} m_\pi^2 F'(m_\pi^2) \Bigg\} \frac{\Delta}{m_q} + \frac{3 N_c}{(4 \pi)^2} \Delta^4 \\
	       &+ \Omega_q + \Omega_e .
\end{split}
\label{eq:lsm2f:grand_potential_consistent}
\end{equation}
In contrast to our conventions, $m_q$, $m_\pi$ and $m_\sigma$ are \emph{vacuum masses} here,
while the dynamic quark mass $\Delta$ corresponds to what we labelled $m_q$ earlier.
In addition, they have defined
\TODO{try to establish common notation after reviewing 3F-model}
\begin{equation}
	F(p^2) = 2 - 2 r \atan \Big(\frac1r\Big), \qquad
	F'(p^2) = \frac{4 m_q^2}{p^4 r} \atan \Big(\frac1r\Big) - \frac{1}{p^2}, \qquad
	r = \sqrt{\frac{4 m_q^2}{p^2}-1} .
\end{equation}
Coincidentally, the renormalization scale $\Lambda$ has disappeared from the original expression \eqref{eq:lsm2f:grand_potential_consistent_before} upon substitution of the renormalized couplings!

Like before, we will set $m_q$, $m_\pi$ and $f_\pi$ to the fixed vacuum values in \cref{tab:lsm2f:parameters}, but vary $m_\sigma$.
Whereas \cref{fig:lsm:potential_sigma_mass} shows that our original inconsistently fit grand potential only had stable minima for $m_\sigma \gtrsim \SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt}$ in vacuum,
\cref{fig:lsm:potential_sigma_mass_ref} shows that it appears for $m_\sigma \gtrsim \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}$ with the consistently fit grand potential.
This allows us to set $m_\sigma$ to values within its measured range $\SI{400}{}$-$\SI{550}{\mega\electronvolt}$ without breaking the model!

Repeating our earlier calculations with the new grand potential \eqref{eq:lsm2f:grand_potential_consistent} for lower values of $m_\sigma$,
we find the equation of state in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos-ref},
the lower bag constant bounds
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	B^\frac14 > \SI{107.3}{\mega\electronvolt}           \quad \Big(\text{or } \big(B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})\big)^\frac14 > \SI{145.4}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big) \qquad \Big(m_\sigma = \SI{400}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big), \\
	B^\frac14 > \phantom{0}\SI{83.9}{\mega\electronvolt} \quad \Big(\text{or } \big(B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})\big)^\frac14 > \SI{145.9}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big) \qquad \Big(m_\sigma = \SI{500}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big), \\
	B^\frac14 > \phantom{0}\SI{27.2}{\mega\electronvolt} \quad \Big(\text{or } \big(B-\pot(f_\pi,\vec{0})\big)^\frac14 > \SI{155.3}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big) \qquad \Big(m_\sigma = \SI{600}{\mega\electronvolt}\Big),
\end{align}%%
\label{eq:lsm:bag_lower_bound_ref}%
\end{subequations}%%
and the mass-radius solutions in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-mass-radius-ref}.

The ``consistent'' results with $m_\sigma=\{400,500,600\} \, \si{\mega\electronvolt}$ are
virtually identical to the ``inconsistent'' results with $m_\sigma=\{600,700,800\} \, \si{\mega\electronvolt}$.
This can be seen by comparing the individual features in \cref{fig:lsm:2-flavor-eos-ref,fig:lsm:2-flavor-mass-radius-ref},
or more easily by noting that the vacuum potentials in \cref{fig:lsm:potential_sigma_mass_ref}
-- \emph{which is the difference between the two approaches} --
more or less coincides with those in \cref{fig:lsm:potential_sigma_mass} that have about $\SI{200}{\mega\electronvolt}$ larger values of $m_\sigma$.

This approach has shown the importance of fitting the parameters of the model in a consistent manner in order to achieve correspondence between experimental and model parameters.
In our original inconsistent approach we had no other choice but to use too large values of $m_\sigma$ to avoid breaking the model and generate any results at all,
leaving us with a doubtful and unsatisfactory feeling.
However, comparison with the consistent approach restores our trust in these results
and tells us that we should not be too worried by fitting too large values of $m_\sigma$ at tree-level.
